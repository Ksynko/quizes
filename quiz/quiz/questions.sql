S is true, R is true but not a valid explanation of S|C. S is true and R is false|D. S is false and R is true|E. both S and R and false	 S is true, R is true and a valid explanation of S	Salivary secretion, amounting to around 1500 ml of saliva per day, is under neural control.  Parasympathetic innervation stimulation causes profuse secretion of watery saliva with a low content of organic material associated with vasodilatation due to the local release of VIP which co-transmits with acetyl choline.  Atropine and other cholinergic blocking agents reduce salivary secretion, blocking the normal reflex secretion of saliva (thus both S & R are correct and R validly explains S).  Sympathetic nerve stimulation of the salivary glands causes vasoconstriction; and secretion of small amounts of saliva with a high organic content.	Anatomy MCQs	Relationship-Analysis (Type B)

The duodenal ?C? defines 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th parts, which are respectively 2, 3, 4 and 1 inches long. The   of duodenum runs  upwards, posteriorly and to the right from the pylorus  (21.1 true).  Its initial 1"  only is mobile and invested in the peritoneal folds of greater and of lesser omenta  (21.2 true); this "duodenal cap" of radiologists is without macroscopic folds, unlike the reminder of the duodenum.  This first 1" of the duodenum forms the lowermost boundary of the opening into the lesser sac (epiploic foramen, foramen of Winslow) (21.4 true).  The fixed second 1" is retroperitoneal and crosses the  anterior surface of the inferior vena cava  (21.3 true), where it lies immediately to the right of the aditus to the lesser sac.  At the junction of its free and fixed halves the first part of duodenum also  crosses the bile duct anteriorly  (22.3 true). An important anterior relation of the first part is the  neck of the gall bladder  and Hartmann?s pouch (22.2 true).  Acute cholecystitis can be associated with impaction of a stone which erodes and fistulates between gall bladder and duodenum to cause gall stone ileus by subsequent impaction, usually in lower small bowel. Like all the rest of the small bowel, the duodenum?s absorbing mucosal surface is enhanced by microscopic villi (22.1 false); and (except for the first 1" of the first part) also by macroscopic folds, the circular plicae or valvulae conniventes.   The first part totals 5cm in length  (22.4 true). The duodenum?s second, third and   parts complete a retroperitoneal C.  The duodenum makes its loop around the head of the pancreas in its first 3 parts, crossing aorta and IVC twice.  The short 4th part to the left of the aorta ascends to the duodenojejunal flexure at the level of L2, below the body of pancreas.  It lies on the left psoas muscle and left lumbar sympathetic trunk (23A true).  The 4th part is bound to the psoas fascia.  The duodenojejunal flexure is also supported by a suspensory ligament with some muscular fibres (ligament of Treitz) running from the right crus in front of the aorta but behind the body of the pancreas. The transverse mesocolon attachment runs along the anterior border of the pancreas and lies above the fourth part and its duodenojejunal flexure (23E false).  The mesentery of the small bowel runs downwards to the right from the duodenojejunal flexure, crossing the 3rd part of duodenum which is also crossed by the superior mesenteric artery and vein ? the vein lying to the right of the artery. The inferior mesenteric artery originates at the level of L4, below the 3rd and 4th parts of duodenum (23C false), and the inferior mesenteric vein ascends to the left of the 4th part to drain into the splenic vein (23B false). The 2nd part of duodenum lies over the pelviureteric junction of right kidney, but the fourth part is medial to the kidney and left ureter throughout (23D false).

94	732	Concerning the blood supply of the liver	A. the hepatic artery inflow and hepatic venous drainage do not communicate across left and right halves of the liver.|B. the portal vein has a Y-shaped division into left and right portal vein branches in the porta hepatis.|C. the hepatic ducts in the porta hepatis lie in front of the branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein.|D. the quadrate and caudate lobes receive their major blood supply from the right hepatic artery and right portal vein.	 the hepatic ducts in the porta hepatis lie in front of the branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein.	The right and left hepatic arteries do not communicate.  Each of the individual right and left arterial branches is functionally an end artery, as are their segmental branches which run together with the accompanying portal vein branches and hepatic duct tributaries in the ensheathing ?portal canals? of histological sections. Arterial and portal venous blood mix in the sinusoids and drain to hepatic vein tributaries in the centre of each ?lobule?, which unite to form the hepatic veins.  The hepatic venous drainage, as distinct from the unmixed vascular inflow, allows mixing of the drainage coming from right and left liver halves (1 false) \r\n  The left and right hepatic veins have a very short extrahepatic course; and drain segments 2 & 3, and 5 & 8 respectively.  A long middle hepatic vein marks the junction between left and right liver halves posteriorly; and receives part of the drainage of both right (segments 6 & 7) and left (segment 4) halves of the liver.  The middle hepatic vein runs vertically and drains into the vena cava or may join the left hepatic vein.  A number of accessory hepatic veins below the main veins drain separately into the vena cava along its length, including one from the caudate lobe. Ligation of the main hepatic artery may be possible without liver infarction because of the double vascular inflow; and has been used to inhibit growth of hepatic metastases.  The operation is now less commonly performed; chemotherapy delivered via percutaneous hepatic arterial infusion is less hazardous and less invasive. Portal venous diversion by portacaval or reversed (Warren) lienorenal shunting can reduce bleeding risks from varices in portal hypertension.  The division of the hepatic artery into right and left hepatic artery branches in the porta hepatis is Y-shaped, and differs from the portal vein bifurcation, which is at a higher level via a T-junction into right and left portal veins (2 false).  The hepatic ducts in the porta hepatis accompany the corresponding arteries.   They lie anteriorly to the arterial and venous branches, rendering the ducts more easily accessible to surgical exploration  (3 true). KEY ISSUE Although quadrate and caudate lobes are described by older nomenclature as part of the right liver lobe (ie the portion lying to the right of the falciform ligament), it is essential surgically to appreciate that functionally the caudate lobe (segment 1) and most of the quadrate lobe (segment 4) belong to the left half of the liver ? they receive blood supply from the left hepatic arterial and left portal vein branches and drain bile to the left hepatic duct (4 false).

Ninety to ninety-five per cent of these are absorbed in the terminal ileum, and returned to the liver via the enterohepatic circulation, and then re-excreted.  In complete obstruction of the common bile duct bile salts accumulate in the serum and itching occurs (S true).  Cholic acid is formed in the liver.  This represents 50% of total bile salt production which amounts to 0.2-0.4 gm/day (R false).  This is recycled, so effectively that 3.5 gm are recycled daily as the bile salt pool.

S is false and R is true|E. both S and R and false	 S is true, R is true but not a valid explanation of S	Pure right ventricular lesions are indeed uncommon, however the rate of onset of symptoms in cardiac failure is related to the mobility of fluid volumes rather than the rate of onset of ischaemic damage to the myocardium. The capacity of the pulmonary system is only a few hundred millilitres, so that in the event of sudden left ventricular dysfunction, significant volume overload of the pulmonary system occurs rapidly with blood flowing in from the systemic circuit and right ventricle.  However, peripheral oedema involves many litres of fluid (often five to ten litres before gross oedema is apparent), which can only be accumulated slowly by dietary intake and renal fluid retention. Thus, it is impossible to suddenly develop peripheral oedema and venous overload. Therefore, the assertion is correct, but the reason given, though it is a true statement in itself, is not a valid reason for the assertion.	Other MCQs	Relationship-Analysis (Type B)

H|CO| is present in the urine in very high concentration compared with plasma	 H	 and HCO  Trainee queried whether option 2 should have been maked false since type A intercalated cells int the distal nephron have a K+/H+ exchanger.  This was refered to the Sub Committee who replied that the question and explanation is still valid : K+ is "normally" secreted in the Tubular fluid.  This question was referred to the Physiology Sub Committee for review on 1 Feb 2002.  The Sub Committee provided the following comment: The net flux of potassium in the distal tubule is secretion rather than absorption.  Most of the secretion is via K channels and is encouraged by the electrical potential difference across the cells, which in turn results from the aldosterone sensitive uptake of sodium through amiloride sensitive channels.  This electrical coupling produces the well know effects of changing the sodium load in the distal tubule on potassium loss and acid base balance.  However, this is all getting very subtle for a Ganong level of renal physiology, where the focus is on the major flux of the ions.	Physiology MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

S is true, R is true but not a valid explanation of S|C. S is true and R is false|D. S is false and R is true|E. both S and R and false	 S is true, R is true and a valid explanation of S	The distribution of atherosclerotic lesions is quite striking: they increase progressively from the thoracic aorta to the iliac and femoro-popliteal systems.  This seems to reflect two properties of the blood pressure. Firstly, because of the erect posture, pressure increases from above down, being some 30 mmHg higher at the level of the inguinal ligaments than at the heart, due to gravity. Systemic hypertension is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. Secondly, the vibrational components of the pressure, that is the pulse wave, increase in the more distal arteries. This is due to dispersive properties where different frequencies propagate at different speeds so that the arterial pulse waveform acquires an exaggerated dicrotic notch and oscillations during diastole in the distal vessels.  Although there is much remaining to be learned about the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, current theories include a role for endothelial injury promoted by wall stress.

S is true, R is true but not a valid explanation of S|C. S is true and R is false|D. S is false and R is true|E. both S and R and false	 S is true, R is true and a valid explanation of S	The formation of a collateral circulation around occlusions of the femoropopliteal and iliac systems is well known. Sudden occlusions cause dramatic symptoms and signs because the collaterals cannot adapt instantaneously: however, slowly developing occlusions may be tolerated because of the development of a rich collateral supply. The mechanisms by which arteries (and indeed veins) respond to such demands are not fully understood; however, it is clear that they respond to flow velocity. The shear stress in the flowing blood is sensed by endothelial cells, which release vasodilators including nitric oxide. Thus, a high flow demand will in the longer term, cause vessel dilatation. The role of transmural pressure is less clear, but it has been long known that muscular arteries and arterioles constrict in response to increased pressure and dilate in response to diminished pressure. This mechanism, known as myogenic pressure autoregulation, might contribute to dilatation in a collateral vessel when the pressure in its distal segment decreases as the main vessel occludes.

Acute pancreatitis exhibits a spectrum of severity.  Severe acute pancreatitis is accompanied by hypovolaemia with massive sequestration of fluid and electrolytes in the abdomen and retroperitoneum. Early correction of such losses is of major importance in treatment, and is the most likely of the responses to influence mortality (C correct) .  Aprotinin and glucagon have been widely used in treatment, but have not been demonstrated effective in influencing mortality in clinical trials (A and B incorrect).  Parenteral nutrition is helpful in treating the complications of acute pancreatitis such as prolonged ileus and abscess formation, but is not so relevant to early mortality (D incorrect). Peritoneal lavage and dialysis have a role in management of acute pancreatitis (particularly when acute pancreatitis is diagnosed at operation) and in the management of local and systemic complications (pancreatic abscess and renal failure).  There is no evidence that they reduce the early mortality (E incorrect).	Pathology MCQs	Multiple Choice (Type A)

You would suspect as the 	A. atelectasis.|B. intra-peritoneal biliary leak.|C. cholangitis.|D. reaction to the contrast medium.|E. wound infection.	 atelectasis.	After an upper abdominal operation such as elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy without bile duct exploration, the commonest complication is postoperative atelectasis, which is especially common in smokers or those with pre-existing chest disease.   Atelectasis commonly presents within the first 12-24 hours after surgery with fever and tachycardia, often without obvious clinical findings in the chest (A correct).  It is thus the most likely of thediagnoses listed. You would of course need to consider operative complications as well! Intraperitoneal bile leak is more likely to occur when the bile duct has been explored, but can follow simple cholecystectomy as a result of leakage from the liver bed or due to the cystic duct clip(s) slipping.  Clinical presentation is often delayed until 24 hours or more after operation, and presentation may be with abdominal signs of varying degree associated with shock. Cholangitis is rare after elective cholecystectomy without bile duct exploration.  The frequency of infected bile rises in operations for acute cholecystitis and with bile duct stones.  Reaction to the contrast medium is les common than atelectasis; and wound infection does not usually present within the first 12 hours.	Pathology MCQs	Multiple Choice (Type A)

S is false and R is true|E. both S and R and false	 S is true and R is false	Heparin acts to potentiate antithrombin III, which inhibits several serine proteases in the intrinsic clotting cascade (but not actually thrombin; the name is misleading). Warfarin, the vitamin K antagonist, blocks the conversion of six clotting factors, including prothrombin, to their active form by inhibiting a process essential to their activation: namely, conversion of glutamate residues to gamma-carboxyglutamate. Thus heparin and warfarin, despite their differences in route of administration, time course of activation, and clinical uses, do have a final common pathway of action: they block the clotting cascade. Aspirin acts to inhibit cyclo-oxygenase in platelets, and thus inhibit platelet aggregation. Platelets have multiple inputs to their aggregation cascade, including contact with collagen and mediators such as ADP released from other platelets. 	Other MCQs	Relationship-Analysis (Type B)
4	737	The cystic artery usually arises from the	A. superior mesenteric artery.|B. hepatic artery directly before its bifurcation.|C. right gastric artery.|D. right branch of the hepatic artery.|E. gastroduodenal artery.	 right branch of the hepatic artery.	The  cystic artery normally arises from the right hepatic artery  (D true) behind the biliary passages to run to the neck of the gall bladder in a triangle formed by the liver, common hepatic duct and cystic duct (Calot?s triangle).  Variations in its origins are very common and are important in gall bladder surgery.  The right hepatic artery may run in front of the common hepatic duct, and the cystic artery may come from such an aberrant right hepatic artery or from the main hepatic artery itself.  In any of these instances the cystic artery may pass in front of the biliary passages to reach the gall bladder, instead of passing behind these structures as is the normal pattern.  An aberrant hepatic artery may be divided, if its course takes it unusually close to the gall bladder, in a mistaken belief that it is the cystic artery. KEY ISSUE The morphological lobes of the liver do not correspond to the right and left sides of the liver.  The portal trinity divides the liver into right and left sides.  The surgical importance of such a division is manifest; the right side of the liver consists of a right lateral (posterior) sector and a rig \r\n 800 \r\n ht medial (anterior) sector.  The left side of the liver consists of left medial (anterior) and left lateral (posterior) sectors.  The right medial (anterior) sector comprises segments 5 & 8, the right lateral (posterior) sector comprises segments 6 & 7; the left medial (anterior) sector comprises segments 3 & 4, and the left lateral (posterior) sector comprises segment 2.  Segment 1 is the caudate lobe receiving branches from both sides and draining independently into vena cava.	Anatomy MCQs	Multiple Choice (Type A)

The patient described in this scenario has a total number of three risk factors, namely a past history of deep venous thrombosis (weighting 2) and she is about to undergo a laparoscopic procedure (weighting 1).  She is classified as low risk and use of anti-embolism stockings or a low molecular weight heparin given subcutaneously is sufficient prophylaxis (C is correct, D is incorrect).  The subcutaneous heparin would only need to be continued until the patient was mobile (E is incorrect).  Intravenous heparin would be more suitable for a high risk patient, particularly one who had been on warfarin before the operation.  The dose mentioned is in any event therapeutic rather than prophylactic (B is incorrect).   \r\n  \r\n There would be few circumstances where warfarin would be commenced immediately after an operation.  If a patient had been on warfarin immediately prior to surgery, it would almost certainly have been stopped and the anticoagulation maintained in the interim with heparin.

8	916	In indirect inguinal hernia, all of the following statements concerning the hernial sac are true\r	A. Passes through the internal inguinal ring.|B. Passes through the external inguinal ring.|C. Runs within the spermatic cord|D. Requires total excision to prevent recurrence|E. Commences lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels	 Requires total excision to prevent recurrence	An indirect inguinal hernia sac may be congenital or acquired.  Inguinal hernias in childhood occur mostly into preformed sacs due to incomplete closure of the processus vaginalis. Hamilton Russell, a prominent Australian surgeon, was a strong proponent of the congenital basis of indirect inguinal hernias.  In adult hernias the sac can be preformed but acquired sacs originating from the internal inguinal ring are also common.  Whether of congenital or acquired origin, the sac of an indirect inguinal hernia originates lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels and passes along the inguinal canal within the spermatic cord, passing successively through the internal (deep) and external (superficial) inguinal rings before giving a palpable groin swelling.  (responses A, B, C, E all true). Herniotomy (exploration followed by excision of the sac) is usual in open repair of an indirect inguinal hernia.   Total sac excision (provided a sound repair of the orificial defect is performed) is not obligatory; and is contradicted in at least two clinical circumstances (D is false and thus is the correct answer). KEY ISSUE Left sided indirect inguinal hernias containing sigmoid colon are quite common in elderly patients and are associated with a large indirect inguinal hernial sac.  The serosa of sigmoid colon in this instance progressively descends as part of the wall of the sac.  The bowel does not lie within the sac lumen, but forms part of its posterior wall.  These are known as sliding hernias ("hernia en glissade").  They usually present clinically as large reducible inguinoscrotal hernias containing bowel.  When diagnosed the sac is simply closed and the defect of the inguinal ring repaired by any of the appropriate techniques. Occasionally the patent processus vaginalis forming a congenital sac remains in its embryonic form.  This leads to a large inguinoscrotal hernia, and on exploration the lower part of the sac is found to be continuous with the coverings of the testis.  The sac must be transected and its lower portion left in situ on the testis and cord.	Anatomy MCQs	Multiple Choice (Type A)

Critically ill patients require 30 g/day of arginine.|D. Arginine is a unique substrate for the production of nitric oxide.|E. Arginine is the preferred nutrient for immunocytes.	 Arginine is a unique substrate for the production of nitric oxide.	Arginine is now considered to be a conditionally essential amino acid. Arginine is synthesised endogenously in the kidney from gut-derived citrulline (the small intestine converts dietary amino acids, including glutamine, to citrulline). Arginine participates in a variety of metabolic functions, including urea synthesis, lymphocyte proliferation, and wound healing. In addition, arginine is a unique substrate for the production of the biologic effector molecule, nitric oxide. This important pathway has been shown to be present in many tissues and cells including endothelium and inflammatory cells. The role of arginine in critically ill patients remain to be defined but doses of up to 30 g/day have been used in evaluative studies. Combinations of nutrients with immune function activity - arginine, fish oil, and nucleic acids - are being evaluated as enteral nutrients in critically ill patients: although they are sometimes referred to as 'immunonutrients', their clinical efficacy has yet to be confirmed by independent clinical trials.

The CT scan illustrated is through one of the lumbar vertebrae, and shows the kidneys on either side of the midline.  The structure  labelled D running from the left kidney towards the midline  is a large structure which must be either the left renal vein or left renal artery.  The size of the structure and subsequent questions make it clear that  it is indeed the left renal vein ; although its insertion into the vena cava after crossing in front of the aorta is not seen; and it looks rather confusingly as if it is originating from the aorta.  This is due to its oblique course so that only the part originating from the kidney coming to the midline is seen.  We are clearly at an upper vertebral level, probably L1.   The left renal vein is about three times as long as its right sided counter part  (1 true).  The right renal vein incidentally can be seen entering the vena cava from the right kidney, and is a short stubby vein usually receiving no tributaries.  The left renal vein, which crosses the aorta to reach the inferior vena cava, receives a number of tributaries.   The left adrenal vein enters it from above , and it may also receive from above the left inferior phrenic vein.  It receives the  left gonadal vein inferiorly .  This junction may or may not contain a valve, which is probably relevant to the development of varicocele in males.  The left renal vein  connects the azygos and vertebral venous systems  (2, 3 & 4 true).  The other major tributaries of the left renal vein of importance are one or more lumbar veins.  These various tributaries and their control are of particular importance in the operation of left nephrectomy.  In living donor nephrectomy, the increased length of the left renal vein makes the use of the left kidney more desirable than the right. The other structures illustrated in the CT scan are the superior mesenteric artery (C) and vein (B) passing in front of the uncinate process of the pancreas (A) with the head of the pancreas to the right of this.  The lower part of the liver is also seen, together with some loops of large and small bowel containing contrast, and the beginnings of psoas and quadratus lumborum posteriorly.

The nerve emerges on the surface of scalenus medius, crosses the first rib to lie on serratus anterior in the medial wall of the axilla, deep to its fascia (A true) and runs vertically downwards behind the mid-axillary line to supply the muscle segmentally.  The axillary (circumflex) nerve, from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, gives no branches in the axilla, and leaves it immediately through the quadrangular space (B true) to run around the neck of the humerus.  The thoraco-dorsal nerve (nerve to latissimus dorsi), from the posterior cord, descends through the axilla to the posterior wall, to enter and supply latissimus dorsi.  It is accompanied by the subscapular vessels, which are initially anterior to the nerves, but reverse their position in the lower axilla (C true).  The musculocutaneous nerve (C7), from the lateral cord, pierces the coracobrachialis muscle after supplying it (D true).  After supplying biceps and brachialis muscles it becomes the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm.	Anatomy MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

Such measures cannot be used to estimate muscle mass.|E. Useful ward-based tests that should be employed by nutrition support teams.	 Values below the 5th percentile are associated with a poor clinical outcome.	Anthropometry uses simple measurements of body thicknesses to estimate fat and lean tissue mass. Triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses provide an index of body fat; and midarm muscle circumference provides a measure of muscle mass. Interpretation of the data may be limited by interobserver variability, age, and hydration status. Nevertheless, markedly abnormal values, below the 5th percentile, are often associated with poor clinical outcome. However, such patients usually look thin and wasted from the foot of the bed. Anthropometry is most appropriate when evaluating groups rather than individuals and starved young populations rather than sick and elderly patients. Hence, they offer a low technology approach to the measurement of body composition that is most applicable to epidemiological surveys of starving third-world populations.

It is the most prevalent male cancer in men over 45 years of age (3 True) .  There is no evidence to suggest that younger patients have a more vigorous course than older patients (2 False), but, rather, as prostate cancer is a relatively slow growing disease and younger patients have less co-morbid illnesses, younger patients are, therefore, more likely to die of their prostate cancer than older patients.   Overall most men die with prostate cancer rather than of prostate cancer (4 True) .  However, this has been shown repeatedly in studies   (50-60 years) diagnosed with the disease.  Prostate cancer claims approximately 2,500 Australian lives per year and, hence, demonstrates a similar incidence and mortality to breast cancer in women. Prostate cancer typically begins in the peripheral zone of the prostate in 70% of cases, which is the zone immediately adjacent to the anterior surface of the rectum.  It only uncommonly involves the transitional/periurethral zones of the prostate (5 False), which explains why prostate cancer typically presents with symptoms late in the cause of the disease rather than early.

It crosses the axilla after emerging from the second intercostal space in the midaxillary line.  It runs within axillary fat to the upper arm, surrounded by lymph nodes of the axilla.  It can be preserved during axillary clearance; but this usually involves compromising the dissection somewhat, and the nerve is usually excised with the specimen in a complete therapeutic axillary clearance.

Most normal flora microbes occur in areas high in humidity and secretions (eg scalp, foot, axilla).  None of the secretions (eg sweat, sebaceous) contains mucus; with the presence of fatty acids, lactate, salt (NaCl), and products of keratinisation in secretions contributing to the 'acid mantle' that covers most skin areas.  The skin of the feet while moist (sweat) is not covered in oily secretions; hence its ability to harbour Gram-negative bacilli such as Acinetobacter and pseudomonads.  All of these properties (dryness of some areas, acidity, resident flora occupying available niches) renders the skin unsuitable as an environment for many microbes.

The phosphate buffer system has a pK of 6.8: ie near to plasma pH and therefore is an ideal buffer.  However, phosphate concentration is quite low compared to bicarbonate concentration (B false).  Proteins are effective buffers because many of the constituent amino acids have pKs close to physiological pH.  However, most of the protein buffering capacity is intracellular (A false).  The bicarbonate system has a pK of 6.1 which is far from ideal for buffering at pH 7.4.  However, the two components of the buffer system can be individually regulated: CO2 by respiration and HCO  - by the kidney.  This dual regulation makes the bicarbonate system the most important for the extracellular fluid (C true).	Physiology MCQs	Multiple Choice (Type A)

The pain of a threatened abortion is often described as colicky and tends to be sited centrally at the pelvic brim. A ruptured ectopic may be localised to the relevant iliac fossa and may be associated with hypotension and shoulder tip pain.  Pain is usually more constant and severe. Amenorrhoea, obviously, will be present in both conditions as conception has taken place (3 True).   For this same reason a serum/urinary b-hCG will be positive, at the time of presentation, in both instances (4 False). Ultrasound of the uterus is the most useful defining investigation (2 True) , as presence of products of conception within the uterine cavity would indicate a threatened abortion.  In the case of a ruptured ectopic one would expect the uterine cavity to be empty.  The ectopic itself may be visualized in a Fallopian tube and fluid (blood) is likely to be seen in the pelvis.

The lowest part of the pleural cavity is the costo-diaphragmatic recess.  The line of its reflection from diaphragm to parietal pleura lining the ribs runs from the lateral sternal edge on the right, at the level of the sixth costal cartilage (on the left the reflection arches out between fourth and sixth costal cartilages about half way to the apex of the heart).  The reflection then runs just above the costal margin anteriorly, crossing the eighth rib at the midclavicular line, and the tenth rib at the mid axillary line.  From this point it runs horizontally around the back, crossing the obliquely running twelfth rib at the lateral border of the erector spinae.  It continues horizontally to the lower border of the twelfth thoracic vertebra.  The lower margin of the pleura thus overlies posteriorly the upper pole of the kidney.  The lower margins of the lungs lie usually about two rib levels above the line of the pleura and its costo-diaphragmatic recess; so that stab wounds can traverse the pleura while missing the lower border of the lung, especially in full expiration. The dome of the diaphragm reaches as high as the level of the eighth thoracic vertebra, which is approximately at the nipple line level.  Stab wounds between the nipple line and the costal margin can thus potentially injure first pleura and lung; and after penetration of the diaphragm, a variety of intra-abdominal organs. The spleen in its surface anatomy lies above the costal margin posterolaterally, with its long axis centred along the line of the tenth rib and extending over an area about as large as a closed fist immediately under the diaphragm, and extending as far forward as the mid axillary line.   A stab wound passing horizontally from the left intercostal space in the mid axillary line and running in the coronal plane can therefore pierce the parietal and diaphragmatic pleura, the diaphragm, and the underlining spleen  (1 and 3 true).  It will be too far forward and too high for kidney, and too low to injure lung (2 and 4 false).	Anatomy MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

Undernutrition is associated with hyperplasia of lymphoid tissues.|C. Correcting the underlying clinical problem does not reverse anergy.|D. The inflammatory response is not depressed during starvation.|E. Delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity is associated with a poor clinical outcome.	 Delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity is associated with a poor clinical outcome.	Immune incompetence, as measured by delayed cutaneous hypersensitivity (DCH), has been shown to be associated with a poor clinical outcome. Although DCH is affected by severe undernutrition, several diseases and drugs influence DCH, making it a poor measure of undernutrition in sick patients. Correcting the underlying medical problem can reverse anergy. Although the levels of immunoglobulins are not reduced in starvation, the ability to synthesise antibodies is likely to be impaired. Cellular aspects of the immune response have also been studied in starvation. It has long been known that undernutrition is frequently associated with atrophy of the lymphoid tissues and depression of cellular immunity. There is evidence that the inflammatory response is depressed during starvation, as evidenced by the decrease in the number and function of neutrophils which is commonly observed in starvation.  It is of interest to note that severely undernourished prisoners in work camps during World War II were prone to develop infections related to poor cellular immunity, especially tuberculosis, but their wounds tended to heal without infection.

During pregnancy, prolactin levels steadily increase until term, reaching a peak at the time of parturition. Prolactin is responsible for the formation of milk and its secretion into the ducts (C true). The hormone responsible for milk 'let down' is oxytocin released in response to touching the nipples and areolae (A false).

It is formed in the body by hydroxylation and decarboxylation of tryptophan.  However, the hydroxylase is not saturated so that an increase in dietary tryptophan can increase brain serotonin content.  After release from serotonergic neurons, much of the released serotonin is returned by an active re-uptake mechanism and inactivated by monamine oxidase to form 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid which is excreted in the urine (D true).

The majority of such men are asymptomatic.  Patients may present with dragging discomfort, particularly following prolonged standing or lifting.  Varicocele may occasionally be associated with infertility and testicular atrophy, but this is not the most common presentation (1 False). Symptomatic varicocele is usually   with a high ligation of the gonadal vein above the pampiniform plexus (2 False).  Ligation may be at the level of inguinal canal or in the retroperitoneum.  Division of the gonadal vein during other abdominal surgery has no apparent effect.  Ligation presumably relieves the pressure effect of the column of blood exerted down the gonadal vein in the standing position.  Venous infarction does not occur as alternative venous return channels develop and open up.

Endotoxins are highly inflammatory compounds and initiate a series of events (starting with activation of excessive amounts of cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor with subsequent vascular endothelial damage) leading to the classic endotoxic or septic shock syndrome (NB a similar series of events can be induced by some toxins from Gram-positive bacteria).  As Gram-positives do not posses an outer membrane in the cell wall structure, endotoxins are limited to Gram-negative bacteria (eg E. coli, pseudomonads).

These include the wearing of face masks and gowns.  On the other hand, preoperative skin shaving of the incisional area does significantly increase the likelihood of subsequent wound sepsis, as does increased staff numbers and movement in the operating theatre (perhaps related to movement of air).  Hair clipping immediately prior to incision is less likely to result in subsequent wound sepsis, than any form of razor shaving.  A reduction in the numbers of microbes colonising the incisional area by the use of topical antiseptics does reduce subsequent wound infection rates, which are invariably endogenous and which may take several weeks to become apparent.

However, in this case upper gastrointestinal surgery raises the distinct possibility of the participation of enterococci, and possibly yeasts.  Although it is generally agreed that empiric cover against yeasts is not at present warranted, certainly the potential for yeasts to be involved should be considered, and requested in specimen cultures. Imipenem-type drugs, and piperacillin/tazobactam have proved to be superior to most antimicrobials in this situation ? apparently covering all important aerobic (eg Gram-negative bacilli, enterococci, staphylococci, streptococci) and obligate anearobes (eg Bacteriodes fragilis, clostridia). Where patients fail to respond as anticipated to one of these drugs, the participation of yeasts such as Candida albicans should be seriously considered. Aminoglycosides such as gentamicin, or third generation cephalosporins like cefotaxine fail to cover obligate anaerobes and bacteria such as Enterococcus faecalis.

The sympathetic supply to the lung - only modest in density - releases noradrenaline, which acts on beta-2-receptors to dilate bronchioles. There is virtually no effect on the vasculature, which in the lung has little autonomic regulation. Its major vasoconstrictor stimulus is hypoxia, which helps match perfusion to ventilation. The pulmonary beta-receptors respond mainly to circulating adrenaline (and asthma drugs).  The lung parenchyma and visceral pleura have no sensation; hence the observation that a localised inflammatory process produces no symptoms until it impinges on the parietal pleura giving pleuritic pain.

S is true and R is false|D. S is false and R is true|E. both S and R and false	 S is true and R is false	In ischaemic cell damage, the early fall in pH is due to loss of ATP and accumulation of AMP, both of which stimulate phosphofructo-kinase and phosphorylase enzyme activity.  This results in increased rate of anaerobic glycolysis causing lactate accumulation which, of course cannot enter the Krebs' cycle/electron exchange pathway due to oxygen depletion.  ATP is generated from creatine phosphate anaerobically, leading to accumulation of acidic inorganic phosphate.  The assertion is correct; the reason is incorrect and does not explain the well-known early fall in pH caused by ischaemia.  Lysosomal enzyme action may contribute to pH alterations (these usually result in pH rise) in the later and extremely complex stages of cell necrosis.	Pathology MCQs	Relationship-Analysis (Type B)

Predisposing associations include diabetes and peripheral vascular disease, trauma, alcoholism, surgery and the use of anti-inflammatory agents (eg NSAIDs). Treatment strategies include excision (with a margin) of involved tissues, and appropriate antimicrobial therapy. In light of the known causal agents, empiric therapy with the likes of cefuroxime (anti-staphylococcal and streptococcal) plus ciprofloxacin (anti-Gram negative bacilli) plus clindamycin or metronidazole (for anaerobes) makes sense. On a pharmacokinetic bases, penicillin and flucloxacillin would appear inferior to the likes of cefuroxime for staphylococci and streptococci.

Clinical presentation is typically insidious and indistinguishable from the symptoms and signs of benign gallbladder disease - palpable enlargement of the gallbladder is distinctly unusual.  According to Robbins, 60-90% of carcinoma of the gallbladder is associated with gallstones - the point is that there is a very significant incidence of cases occurring without gallstones and the overall incidence of gallbladder carcinoma in patients with gallstones is so low that prophylactic cholecystectomy for gallstones is considered unjustified.  By the time these cancers are discovered, most have invaded the liver.	Pathology MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

322	27543	Concerning the ovary	A. luteinising hormone stimulates the secretion of oestrogen from the theca interna|B. follicle-stimulating hormone regulates the theca interna|C. plasma oestrogen level peaks about day 8 of a 28-day menstrual cycle|D. during the first trimester of pregnancy, bilateral oophorectomy may be followed by abortion	 luteinising hormone stimulates the secretion of oestrogen from the theca interna, during the first trimester of pregnancy, bilateral oophorectomy may be followed by abortion	Guyton A, Hall J, Textbook of Medical Physiology, WB Saunders, 1996, 9th Edition; Ch 81. Both follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) are secreted by the anterior pituitary in response to stimulation of the pituitary by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secreted by the hypothalamus. Ovarian function is entirely dependent on stimulation by FSH/LH.  FSH, in particular, stimulates the accelerated growth of 6-12 primary follicles with rapid proliferation of granulosa cells as well as a second class of cells that form theca interna and externa.  As its name suggests the development of the primary follicle to vesicular follicle is due to FSH. Both granulosa cells and theca interna cells secrete oestrogens.  Granulosa cells initially have FSH receptors but later develop LH receptors.  Theca interna cells have LH receptors, not FSH (2 False); and  also secrete oestrogens under the stimulus of LH (1 True) . LH is needed for the final development of the follicle, as well as ovulation.  There is a rapid rise of both LH & FSH in the hours before ovulation.  LH then seems to convert the granulosa and theca interna cells into a more progesterone-secreting type of cell. The rise and fall of the various hormones are seen subsequently in  .  Plasma oestrogen levels peak near ovulation in midcycle (3 False). The progesterone secreted by ovarian corpus luteum in the second half of the menstrual cycle prepares a receptive endometrium for the fertilised ovum  .  After implantation, ongoing nutrition of this conceptus is dependent on corpus luteum secretion of progesterone, oestrogen and relaxin.  After about six weeks the placenta is able to produce enough oestrogen and progesterone to maintain pregnancy.    Oophorectomy before the sixth week will thus lead to abortion (4 True) .

1411	27695	The following statements are correct regarding treatment of testicular tumours	A. seminoma is highly radiosensitive|B. most centres adopt a management policy of intense surveillance without additional therapy after orchidectomy for organ-confined seminoma|C. most centres adopt a management policy of intense surveillance without additional therapy after orchidectomy for organ-confined non-seminomatous germ cell tumour|D. residual masses in the chest and retroperitoneum after chemotherapy for non-seminoma are best managed by surgical resection|E. a solid mass arising within the testis has a 50% risk of being malignant	 seminoma is highly radiosensitive, most centres adopt a management policy of intense surveillance without additional therapy after orchidectomy for organ-confined non-seminomatous germ cell tumour, residual masses in the chest and retroperitoneum after chemotherapy for non-seminoma are best managed by surgical resection	Seminoma is exquisitely radiosensitive (1 True)  and for stage I and early stage II tumors 95% of patients are cured with retroperitoneal low dose radiotherapy.  (Delivery of 25-30 Gray to the retroperitoneal and ipsilateral pelvic lymph nodes). Response 2 is false.  Seminomas of high stage and with bulky retroperitoneal nodes or distant metastatic disease are treated with systemic chemotherapy using a regime of Bleomycin, Etoposide and Cis-platinum.  Four cycles of treatment, three weeks apart, are associated with cure rates of >90% in this group of patients.  The treatment of node negative disease is more controversial. 'Watchful-waiting' in this group has several disadvantages: Conclusion  - Radiotherapy to the retroperitoneal lymph nodes for stage I disease is the preferred treatment in the vast majority of centres.  Stage 1 non-seminomatous germ cell tumour is treated with surveillance after orchidectomy (3 True) .  Seventy-five per cent of patients with stage 1 NSGCT are cured with inguinal orchidectomy alone.  Twenty-five per cent of patients relapse, usually in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes within two years.  For this reason close follow-up with chest x-rays, CT, and tumour markers on clinical examination are appropriate.  Tumour markers are checked six-weekly on clinical examination and chest x-rays and CT scans are checked three-monthly in the first year; with gradually diminishing intensity of follow-up over the subsequent two to three years.  The majority of relapses occur within the first year and many cases of residual disease are detected by failure of tumor markers to normalise following inguinal orchidectomy. Overall in this group 25% of patients will develop recurrent disease.  This risk increases to 45-50% in patients with embryonal cancer, with vascular invasion present in the inguinal orchidectomy specimen, or with a higher T stage.  In patients who develop recurrent disease the appropriate treatment in the first instance is chemotherapy, again, initially with four cycles of BEP.  Greater than 90% of patients can expect to be cured. (Response 4 is true)  High stage NSGST is treated initially following orchidectomy with chemotherapy.   If residual retroperitoneal mass exists despite chemotherapy and tumour marker normalisation, retroperitoneal lymph nodes dissection is required .  Twenty per cent of these masses contain residual tumour, 40% mature teratoma, and 40% fibrosis.  (Mature teratoma is generally benign but may cause local compression to neighbouring structures and can rarely undergo malignant degeneration.) Overall, 70% of patients with high volume disease are cured with chemotherapy +/- retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.   Residual chest masses similarly are best excised . The risk of malignancy is very high in patients with a solid testicular mass (5 False).  Such patients have a testicular malignancy until proven otherwise.	Other MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)
1682	778	The pancreas usually receives arterial branches from the	A. splenic artery.|B. left gastric artery.|C. superior mesenteric artery.|D. right gastro epiploic artery.	 splenic artery., superior mesenteric artery.	The pancreas is almost entirely retroperitoneal, forming an important posterior relationship of the stomach in the stomach bed  behind the lesser sac .  It consists of head, neck, body and tail.   The neck covers the origin of the portal vein from superior mesenteric and splenic vein junctions; the splenic vein lies behind much of the body of the pancreas, while the splenic artery runs to the left just above its upper border  (33.1, 2, 3, 4 true).  The body and tail cover the hilum of the left kidney; and the tail lies within the two layers of the lienorenal ligament, and thus abuts on the hilum of the spleen accompanied by the splenic vessels and associated lymph nodes (34 F1, T 2, 3, 4).  The main pancreatic duct running from the tail to the head drains into the duodenal papilla about halfway down the second part of the duodenum.   All the pancreas except for the uncinate process and lower part of the head are drained by the main pancreatic duct .  The accessory pancreatic duct draining the remaining structures opens more proximally into the second part of the duodenum.   Communication between the two duct systems is common  (32.1 & 3 true, 2 & 4 false). The blood supply of the pancreas straddles the junction of the coeliac and superior mesenteric arterial territories.  The main supply is by the splenic artery from the coeliac axis which gives the artery pancreatica magna running the length of the organ.  Much of the head is supplied by pancreaticoduodenal arteries arising both from coeliac and  superior mesenteric arteries  (35.1 & 3 true, 2 & 4 false).  Venous return is by numerous small veins running to the splenic vein along the tail and body and into superior mesenteric and portal veins from the head.  The development of the pancreas as a dorsal and ventral bud into both dorsal and ventral mesogastria (the latter in common with the bile duct) leads to close adherence of the pancreas within the concavity of the duodenal C and to multiple vascular connections via pancreaticoduodenal vessels across this junction.  Pancreatic resections thus usually require removal of the adjacent duodenal second part.  In pancreatico-duodenectomy careful separation of the pancreas from its portal venous connections is the key feature of the operation.  In pancreatic transplantation it is necessary to use both the superior mesenteric artery and the splenic artery inflow (either as separate anastomoses or using a Carrel patch from the aorta containing the origin of both vessels), to use the portal vein as the venous effluent, and to transplant the pancreas and second part of duodenum as a composite block, draining exocrine pancreatic secretions into gut or bladder.  The pancreas can be transplanted either into the portal venous circulation or into the systemic venous circulation without apparent variation in results.	Anatomy MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

The bile duct is formed by the junction of cystic duct with common hepatic duct (1 false), which in turn is formed by the junction of right and left hepatic ducts.  The bile duct is most surgically accessible in its upper third where  it lies in the free edge of the lesser omentum  supraduodenally to the right of the hepatic artery and in front of the portal vein (2 true).  The bile duct in its second third passes behind the duodenum inclining to the right away from the portal vein, which runs more vertically.  The lowest third then runs behind the pancreas in a groove between the head of the pancreas and the C of the duodenum, now some distance to the right of the portal vein which lies behind the neck of the pancreas (3 false).  The bile duct  opens into the duodenum at the ampulla approximately 10cm from the pylorus  (4 true). KEY ISSUE The most surgically important variations of the biliary ducts are cystic duct anomalies - these range from an absence of cystic duct with the gall bladder opening directly into the common hepatic duct, to a long cystic duct entering the main duct system so low down in the third part of the main channel that there is effectively no (common) bile duct, just a long common hepatic duct and adjacent cystic duct - often united by a fascial ensheathment.  The cystic duct may also drain into the right hepatic duct or into an aberrant or accessory right hepatic duct.	Anatomy MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

S is true and R is false|D. S is false and R is true|E. both S and R and false	 S is true and R is false	In ischaemic cell damage, the early fall in pH is due to loss of ATP and accumulation of AMP, both of which stimulate phosphofructo-kinase and phosphorylase enzyme activity.  This results in increased rate of anaerobic glycolysis causing lactate accumulation which, of course cannot enter the Krebs' cycle/electron exchange pathway due to oxygen depletion.  ATP is generated from creatine phosphate anaerobically, leading to accumulation of acidic inorganic phosphate.  The assertion is correct; the reason is incorrect and does not explain the well-known early fall in pH caused by ischaemia.  Lysosomal enzyme action may contribute to pH alterations (these usually result in pH rise) in the later and extremely complex stages of cell necrosis.	Pathology MCQs	Relationship-Analysis (Type B)

1416	11718	Aminoglycosides	A. have activity against Gram-negative bacilli|B. reveal synergy with penicillins|C. tend to accumulate in renal tissues|D. are well absorbed after oral administration	 have activity against Gram-negative bacilli, reveal synergy with penicillins, tend to accumulate in renal tissues	Aminoglycosides are generally safe drugs with known adverse effects, which can be administered by intravenous or intramuscular push or infusion over 15-20 minutes, and which show excellent activity against many Gram-negative bacilli.  They also have often unappreciated anti-Staphylococcus aureus activity (including some MRSA), but are devoid of therapeutic anti-anaerobe activity.  Although ineffective by themselves against enterococci and streptococci, they reveal synergy with penicillins against these two groups of bacteria.  Older regimens of 8-12 hourly dosing, have in many cases been replaced by 24 hourly schedules.  This is because aminoglycosides display concentration-dependent bacterial killing (unlike the ?-lactams), and a pronounced post-antibiotic effect (PAE) against many bacteria.  In addition, complete 'wash out' of the previous dose before administering the next dose results in enhanced cidal activity of the second dose (bacteria exhibit what has been termed adaptive resistance in the presence of low levels of the drug), while once a day dosing is clearly less toxic (to kidney and ear) than multiple daily doses.  The most feared complications of aminoglycoside use are nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity.  These both result from excessive local accumulation of drug in the presence of poor or deteriorating renal function.  Monitoring of trough levels is essential in all patients receiving more than a couple of days of aminoglycoside therapy, especially in the elderly or where renal function is deteriorating.  Renal toxicity is reversible, although ototoxicity is not.  Some evidence is available that susceptibility to ototoxicity is related to a defect (mutation) in a mitochondrial gene.  Aminoglycosides are not absorbed from the alimentary tract, and cannot be given orally if systemic distribution is required.	Other MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

"Pyloric" stenosis occurs when the gastric outlet is obstructed by a benign duodenal or prepyloric ulcer or by a stomach cancer.  Loss of gastric acid from prolonged vomiting can cause extracellular metabolic alkalosis (4 false), particularly when the cause of the obstruction is a peptic ulcer associated with hypersecretion of acid.  Serum bicarbonate rises and serum chloride falls, with a rise in blood pH (2 false).  The renal response of urinary bicarbonate excretion is initially associated with an alkaline urine containing sodium, potassium and bicarbonate.  Subsequently the urine can become acid ("paradoxical aciduria") (3 true) after prolonged vomiting with continuing combined gastrointestinal and urinary losses of water and electrolytes, associated with gross deficiencies in water, sodium, chloride and potassium with  low serum potassium  (1 true).  The late aciduria is associated with hydrogen ion excretion by renal tubular cells in the face of severe depletion of the cations sodium and potassium.

The cells of the gastric glands secrete 2.5 litres of gastric juice daily.  Regulation is by neural and humoral mechanisms.  Vagal stimulation increases gastrin secretion by release of gastrin-releasing-peptide and acetylcholine.  It is convenient to break up the physiological regulation of gastric secretion into cephalic, gastric and intestinal influences.   Cephalic  influences are vagally-mediated responses induced by activity in the CNS.  The gastric influences are primarily local reflex responses and responses to gastrin.  The intestinal influences are the reflex and hormonal feedback effects on gastric secretion initiated from the small intestine.   Resection of large segments of small intestine is associated with hypersecretion of acid (2 true). Vagal stimulation increases the secretion of acid and pepsin  (1 true).  Vagotomy affects only the cephalic phase of secretion, and diminishes (but does not abolish) acid secretion.  Gastrin is produced by G cells in the gastric antral mucosa and stimulates gastric acid and pepsin secretion.  Acid in the antrum inhibits gastric secretion by a feedback mechanism involving somatostatin.  Gastric motility is also reduced (but not abolished) after vagotomy (3 & 4 false).  Gastric drainage procedures are required if total truncal vagotomy is performed, but not with highly selective vagotomy. All these operations are now relatively rare for peptic ulcer disease due to the effectiveness of H2 receptor blockers and proton pump inhibitors; and by control of infection from the bacterium  Helicobacter pylori  which disrupts the mucus barrier (as does aspirin and other NSAIDs).

PSA serum levels are unaffected by age of the patient|D. PSA serum levels may be elevated in benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis or prostatic infarct|E. PSA is universally endorsed and recommended as a screening test for prostate cancer	 PSA is a glycoprotein secreted by prostate cells into the ejaculate, PSA serum levels may be elevated in benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis or prostatic infarct	Prostate specific antigen is a glycoprotein secreted by the prostate cells into the ejaculate (1 True) , whose functions is to assist in the breaking down of gel proteins within the ejaculate - leading to liquefaction.  Small quantities of prostate specific antigen leak into the peripheral circulation and hence can be detected on serum studies.  Prostate specific antigen is not always elevated in the presence of prostate cancer (2 False) and up to 20% of cancers may be missed if relying on prostate specific antigen levels alone.  Digital rectal examination must, therefore, be done in all patients who wish a check up of their prostate.   Prostate specific antigen levels can be elevated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatitis and prostatic infarct and hence 70-80% of men with mildly elevated levels will, in fact, have one of these conditions rather than prostate cancer (4 True) . As one would expect, the degree of benign prostatic hyperplasia tends to increase with age - one would also expect prostatic specific antigen levels to similarly increase with age, and age specific levels have been designed by many laboratories to take this factor into account (3 False).  The use of prostate specific antigen as a formal screening test for prostate cancer is controversial.  It is endorsed by the American Urologic Association as well as the American Cancer Society, but it is not endorsed in many other countries including Australia and New Zealand (5 False).  This uncertainty regarding its efficacy for screening is based on the lack of results of randomised controlled trials identifying a mortality benefit.  Nonetheless, PSA detected cancers are significant cancers based on volume of tumor and histological grade and are more likely to be confined within the prostate and hence amenable to cure.  A reduction in mortality has been seen in the 1990's throughout the world including Australia, which may possibly be due to PSA based screening.  Obviously definitive results of the randomised controlled trials will provide an answer, which will settle this controversy, but unfortunately these answers may only be available in five to ten years time.  Until then the uncertainties of the benefits of screening must be discussed with the patient and informed consent obtained.	Other MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

Absence of sweating over the radial three digits on their volar surfaces would suggest median nerve injury.	Knife wounds commonly involve the front of the wrist as illustrated.  Accurate identification of tendon, nerve and vessel injuries is essential to facilitate management. The median nerve just above the wrist lies near to or in the midline.  It is found just to the radial side of the tendon of flexor digitorum superficialis to the midline finger. The radial artery lies superficially on the far radial side of the wrist, lateral to the prominent tendon of flexor carpi radialis. The ulnar nerve accompanies the ulnar artery, the nerve lying on the ulnar side of the artery.  Artery and nerve lie close together on the surface of the flexor digitorum profundus muscle beneath its investing fascia. Both median and ulnar nerves have given off their motor branches to the forearm flexor muscles by the time they reach the wrist. The median nerve has supplied the radial flexor of the wrist - flexor carpi radialis - and if present, also palmaris longus.  It has also supplied all of flexor digitorum superficialis which flexes the proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers; and by its anterior interosseous branch it has supplied the deep flexors on the radial side - the flexor pollicis longus flexing the end joint of the thumb, and the flexor digitorum profundus to index and middle fingers flexing the terminal interphalangeal joints of these fingers.  The ulnar nerve has already supplied the deep flexors of ring and little fingers. Responses 1, 2, and 3 dealing with function of the forearm - innervated flexor tendons to the fingers and wrist are thus irrelevant to injuries of the median and ulnar nerves at the wrist, which will not affect the branches previously given off by both nerves to these muscles.  Response 4 is also incorrect - there is deformity of the index and middle fingers, but it is  not  due to a nerve injury. Any or all of the flexor tendons of wrist, thumb and fingers may have been divided, and the deformity assumed by the hand and fingers helps us to diagnose these.  Characteristic deformities occur with acute divisions of tendons.  The normal position of rest of the hand (when no muscles are actively contracting, but with normal elastic tensions involving all intact muscles) is with the fingers all flexed towards the palm, and the thumb at right angles to the fingers and lying against the curled index and middle fingers.  The fingers are progressively more curled into the palm as we move from index, to middle, ring, and little finger.  In this patient the ring and little fingers look normally flexed, but the index and middle fingers are extended and straight, and the thumb also looks abnormally straight.  He has almost certainly divided the flexor digitorum superficialis and also the flexor digitorum profundus tendons to the index and middle fingers.  He probably has also divided the flexor pollicis longus tendon. With these injuries, he is almost certain to have divided additionally the more superficial flexor carpi radialis tendon and palmaris longus, if this is present.  Confirmation of each of these tendon injuries, and checking for any others, should be meticulously sought. The cooperative patient is asked to flex against resistance, firstly the terminal joints of thumb and all fingers.  This should confirm the loss of flexion in thumb, index and middle fingers, and will establish if the deep flexors of ring and little fingers are intact. In the circumstances of pain and anxiety following an injury, an isolated division of the more superficial flexor digitorum sublimis tendon will be difficult to diagnose, as the intact deep flexor can also flex the proximal interphalangeal joint.  Flexor digitorum profundus needs to be incapacitated before the isolated action of flexor digitorum sublimis on the proximal interphalangeal joint can be tested. In this instance, however, having confirmed that the profundus tendons to index and middle fingers are not acting, one can then proceed to test flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joints of those fingers, which can confirm that in these fingers at least, FDS has been severed. The wrist flexors are also tested, by palpating and observing the prominent tendons of flexor carpi radialis and flexor carpi ulnaris while the patient is asked to flex the wrist.  Given the injuries to the deeper flexor tendons to the fingers, flexor carpi radialis will almost certainly be found to be severed also. We need separately to test for injury to the median and ulnar nerves .  Again, given the injury to the tendons, the median nerve at least is very likely to have been divided, but all our testing to date has been for tendon injuries, not nerve injury. If the patient is conscious and cooperative, testing for nerve function will be easy by assessing sensation and motor function below the site of the cut.  Loss of sensation to light touch over the volar aspects of thumb, index and middle fingers, including the pulps, and half of the ring finger will be found in a median nerve injury.  Loss of sensation to the corresponding areas of little finger and half of the ring finger will be found in an ulnar nerve injury. It is essential to confirm this diagnosis by checking that the expected loss of motor activity in the short hand muscles is also present.  There are many deformities and tests relevant to later manifestations of nerve palsies - however in the acute situation wasting and late deformities will not be present.  The best test for median nerve function is to check by palpation and observation whether abductor pollicis brevis is acting.  Can the patient abduct the thumb (held at right angles to the other fingers)  away from the palm  and at right angles to it, and can you see and feel the muscle contract while the action occurs? For the ulnar nerve, can the patient abduct the little finger away from the others in the  plane of the palm , and can you see and feel the contraction of abductor digiti minimi as this occurs? Adult patients may be uncooperative from the influence of alcohol, drugs or anxiety.  Children pose special difficulties.  In both these instances checking the third component of the peripheral nerve - namely inspection of hand sweating for autonomic paralysis - can be very helpful.   Absence of sweating in median or ulnar nerve distribution suggests injury to the appropriate nerve (5 is correct).	Other MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

Health care workers may be immune to this disease: ie they possess antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), due to prior immunisation or infection. Those who suspect or know they have had significant contact and/or exposure (eg needle stick injury) with a HBV carrier (ie a person who is positive for the hepatitis B surface antigen, HBsAg) should be directed to an appropriate clinician for testing of their immunological status to HBV. At present, there are three hepatitis B vaccines available - all are non-infectious sub-unit vaccines derived from genetically engineered yeast cells. Seroconversion (immunity) occurs in most subjects after two vaccine doses but should never be assumed without serological proof. Three doses are normally given.  Booster doses are presently recommended, at  \r\n 5-year intervals for health care workers. Protective immunity is recognised by an anti-HBs response  \r\n (ie development of antibody to HBsAg). This test becomes positive in most people after recovery from acute infection with HBV, and also in persons successfully vaccinated. A positive test for HBs Ag indicates active infection and potential infectivity. A low percentage of acutely infected individuals develop chronic infection and remain HBsAg positive. Such 'carrier' rates may reach around 1:1000 or greater in some populations.   \n The other HBV antigen of importance is the 'e' or early antigen (HBeAg).  Persons with circulating 'e' antigen (HBeAg positive) pose a greater risk of infection to contacts than those who are HBsAg positive but HBeAg negative.  While HBeAg has been recommended as identifying infectious individuals, it does not reliably identify all infectious people.  HBV contains double stranded DNA and detection of HBV DNA provides a measure of how much HBV is present in a sample, and is therefore a direct marker of infectivity.

1412	27675	Hormone manipulation for prostate cancer can be optimally administered by	A. orchidectomy|B. LHRH agonist|C. antiandrogen therapy|D. orchidectomy plus antiandrogen therapy|E. LHRH plus antiandrogen therapy	 orchidectomy, LHRH agonist	Prostate cancer is a known hormonally sensitive cancer in 80% of cases and will respond to testosterone deprivation therapy.   The bulk of the male androgens come from the testes and hence either a surgical castration in the form of a bilateral orchidectomy or a medical castration in the form of an LHRH agonist, for example, Zoladex (10.8mg subcutaneously three-monthly) or Lucrin depot (22.5mg IM three-monthly) are acceptable alternatives (1 & 2 True) .  There is no need to add an LHRH to an orchidectomy, as they serve the same function, and side-effects are identical (namely, hot flushes, impotence, weight gain, gynaecomastia and mood disturbances).  Oral anti-androgen therapy alone has generally not been recognised as adequate treatment (3 False) although the steroidal anti-androgen Cyproterone Acetate (100mg three times a day) may be used as monotherapy in selective cases.  The non-steroidal anti-androgens, namely, Flutamide (250mg orally TDS), Nilutamide (150-300mg daily), and Bicalutamide (50mg a day) are not as effective as monotherapy in current dosage schedules.  The anti-androgens have the theoretic advantage that they may eradicate the additional 5-10% of male androgens that are derived from the adrenal gland rather than from the testes.  Hence there has been considerable debate, as to whether combined androgen blockade, in the form of an orchidectomy, or LHRH agonist in conjunction with an anti-androgen may provide superior results to an orchidectomy or LHRH agonist alone.  Although some randomised controlled trials do show a slight survival advantage in the combined androgen blockade group, this data overall has not been conclusive with many conflicting reports showing no benefit (4 & 5 False).    shows the hormonal influences affecting the prostate cell and the site of action of some drugs used in treatment of prostate cancer. LHRH analogues inhibit pituitary secretion and diminish testosterone secretion, as does orchidectomy.  Anti-androgens act peripherally to block testosterone action on androgen receptors.  Agents such as ketoconazole and aminoglutethamide inhibit circulating androgens.	Other MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

Absence of sweating over the radial three digits on their volar surfaces would suggest median nerve injury.	Knife wounds commonly involve the front of the wrist as illustrated.  Accurate identification of tendon, nerve and vessel injuries is essential to facilitate management. The median nerve just above the wrist lies near to or in the midline.  It is found just to the radial side of the tendon of flexor digitorum superficialis to the midline finger. The radial artery lies superficially on the far radial side of the wrist, lateral to the prominent tendon of flexor carpi radialis. The ulnar nerve accompanies the ulnar artery, the nerve lying on the ulnar side of the artery.  Artery and nerve lie close together on the surface of the flexor digitorum profundus muscle beneath its investing fascia. Both median and ulnar nerves have given off their motor branches to the forearm flexor muscles by the time they reach the wrist. The median nerve has supplied the radial flexor of the wrist - flexor carpi radialis - and if present, also palmaris longus.  It has also supplied all of flexor digitorum superficialis which flexes the proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers; and by its anterior interosseous branch it has supplied the deep flexors on the radial side - the flexor pollicis longus flexing the end joint of the thumb, and the flexor digitorum profundus to index and middle fingers flexing the terminal interphalangeal joints of these fingers.  The ulnar nerve has already supplied the deep flexors of ring and little fingers. Responses 1, 2, and 3 dealing with function of the forearm - innervated flexor tendons to the fingers and wrist are thus irrelevant to injuries of the median and ulnar nerves at the wrist, which will not affect the branches previously given off by both nerves to these muscles.  Response 4 is also incorrect - there is deformity of the index and middle fingers, but it is  not  due to a nerve injury. Any or all of the flexor tendons of wrist, thumb and fingers may have been divided, and the deformity assumed by the hand and fingers helps us to diagnose these.  Characteristic deformities occur with acute divisions of tendons.  The normal position of rest of the hand (when no muscles are actively contracting, but with normal elastic tensions involving all intact muscles) is with the fingers all flexed towards the palm, and the thumb at right angles to the fingers and lying against the curled index and middle fingers.  The fingers are progressively more curled into the palm as we move from index, to middle, ring, and little finger.  In this patient the ring and little fingers look normally flexed, but the index and middle fingers are extended and straight, and the thumb also looks abnormally straight.  He has almost certainly divided the flexor digitorum superficialis and also the flexor digitorum profundus tendons to the index and middle fingers.  He probably has also divided the flexor pollicis longus tendon.  With these injuries, he is almost certain to have divided additionally the more superficial flexor carpi radialis tendon and palmaris longus, if this is present.  Confirmation of each of these tendon injuries, and checking for any others, should be meticulously sought. The cooperative patient is asked to flex against resistance, firstly the terminal joints of thumb and all fingers.  This should confirm the loss of flexion in thumb, index and middle fingers, and will establish if the deep flexors of ring and little fingers are intact. In the circumstances of pain and anxiety following an injury, an isolated division of the more superficial flexor digitorum sublimis tendon will be difficult to diagnose, as the intact deep flexor can also flex the proximal interphalangeal joint.  Flexor digitorum profundus needs to be incapacitated before the isolated action of flexor digitorum sublimis on the proximal interphalangeal joint can be tested. \r\n  In this instance, however, having confirmed that the profundus tendons to index and middle fingers are not acting, one can then proceed to test flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joints of those fingers, which can confirm that in these fingers at least, FDS has been severed. The wrist flexors are also tested, by palpating and observing the prominent tendons of flexor carpi radialis and flexor carpi ulnaris while the patient is asked to flex the wrist.  Given the injuries to the deeper flexor tendons to the fingers, flexor carpi radialis will almost certainly be found to be severed also. We need separately to test for injury to the median and ulnar nerves.   Again, given the injury to the tendons, the median nerve at least is very likely to have been divided, but all our testing to date has been for tendon injuries, not nerve injury. If the patient is conscious and cooperative, testing for nerve function will be easy by assessing sensation and motor function below the site of the cut.  Loss of sensation to light touch over the volar aspects of thumb, index and middle fingers, including the pulps, and half of the ring finger will be found in a median nerve injury.  Loss of sensation to the corresponding areas of little finger and half of the ring finger will be found in an ulnar nerve injury. It is essential to confirm this diagnosis by checking that the expected loss of motor activity in the short hand muscles is also present.  There are many deformities and tests relevant to later manifestations of nerve palsies - however in the acute situation wasting and late deformities will not be present.  The best test for median nerve function is to check by palpation and observation whether abductor pollicis brevis is acting.  Can the patient abduct the thumb (held at right angles to the other fingers)  away from the palm  and at right angles to it, and can you see and feel the muscle contract while the action occurs? For the ulnar nerve, can the patient abduct the little finger away from the others in the  plane of the palm , and can you see and feel the contraction of abductor digiti minimi as this occurs? Adult patients may be uncooperative from the influence of alcohol, drugs or anxiety.  Children pose special difficulties.  In both these instances checking the third component of the peripheral nerve - namely inspection of hand sweating for autonomic paralysis - can be very helpful.   Absence of sweating in median or ulnar nerve distribution suggests injury to the appropriate nerve (5 is correct). 	Other MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

Acceptable prophylaxis for large bowel surgery must cover these 3 microbes.  The combination of amoxycillin plus metronidazole, while adequately covering B. fragilis (metronidazole), is devoid of cover against E. coli (at least 50% of E. coli strains are resistant to amoxycillin by ?-lactamase production), or S. aureus (over 80% elaborate penicillinases which inactivate amoxycillin).  The 'second generation' cephalosporin cefotetan (in fact a 7-methoxy cephalosporin or cephamycin), provides adequate prophylactic cover against all 3 bacteria, although being only of doubtful use for established and ongoing intraabnormal sepsis.  The combination of flucloxacillin plus metronidazole is devoid of any cover against E. coli-like coliforms, although adequate for S. aureus (flucloxacillin) and B. fragilis (metronidazole).  Tobramycin alone is devoid of any obligate anaerobe activity, although being excellent for E. coli and probably S. aureus.  In addition, anaesthetic agents may potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effects of aminoglycosides.  For this reason they are probably best avoided in prophylactic regimens.

Hence ongoing bone pain is an issue and if affecting the thoracic/lumbar cord may lead to cord compression and to a rapid onset of paraparesis and paraplegia in affected individuals (1 True) .  This needs prompt treatment with urgent radiotherapy, or if unsuccessful urgent decompression laminectomy.  Other strategies to assist in the management of bone pain include local radiotherapy, chemotherapy using mitozantrone and steroids, administration of radioactive strontium or palladium, referral to palliative care team and administration of analgesia (for example, MS Contin). The other problems relate to local growth of tumour, which include ongoing lower urinary tract symptoms, such as hesitancy, diminishing urinary stream, frequency, and nocturia (which may require palliative TURP) as well as  haematuria due to the fragility of the neoplastic blood vessels (which may require cystoscopy and diathermy) (2 True).  As the tumour infiltrates the base of the bladder, bilateral ureteric obstruction is a common accompaniment of the disease requiring endoscopic manipulation in the form of nephrostomies and ureteric stents (4 True) .

In all of these , ?wound contraction? leads to a scar which, in uncomplicated healing, is smaller than the original tissue it replaces;  in other circumstances, this leads to such problems as bowel obstruction in cancer, Crohn disease etc.  All of the suggested functions and the cell origin are true.  ?Wound contraction? is common and important - that message does not come through clearly in Robbins, but the gist of the phenomenon and its importance is clear - where there is granulation tissue, there is wound contraction, occurring early in connective tissue healing.

Other accepted, but less significant factors include increasing age and obesity, while skin shaving clearly results in increased local microbial growth (attributable in traumatic injury/increased fluid) and the potential for subsequent wound infection.  Hairs should be clipped (rather than shaved at any time) with this being carried out immediately prior to incision.  Blood with its associated cells, fluid and oxygen, is a primary host defence 'barrier' against infection, which more readily becomes established in non vascularised/necrotic tissue.

MRSA strains are resistant to all ?-lactams (eg penicillin, flucloxacillin, coamoxyclav, cefuroxime, and imipenem), because of this new target PBP.  Since the late 1950s, most (around 80% plus) strains of S. aureus have been resistant to many penicillins (eg benzylpenicillin, amoxycillin, piperacillin) because of the production of penicillinases (?-lactamases) which destroy the biological activity of the drug.  Penicillinase-stable penicillins (eg flucloxacillin, coamoxyclav) must be used for the empiric treatment of S. aureus infections.  MRSA strains, which only became common around the early 1990s, are resistant to these classical antistaphylococcal (ie penicillinase-stable) penicillins.  The only antibiotic to which 100% of MRSA strains are consistently susceptible is vancomycin; although MRSA strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin are slowly appearing world-wide.  In countries such as New Zealand and Australia, MRSA strains are community (cMRSA) as well as hospital based.  While most hospital MRSA strains are multiresistant - ie also resistant to a variety of non ?-lactam antistaphylococcal agents - most cMRSA are not, and are susceptible to agents such as cotrimoxazole, fusidic acid, rifampicin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin.  Treatment of cMRSA infections usually relies on a combination of two of these drugs.	Other MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

352	27617	Concerning post-menopausal vaginal bleeding	A. exogenous oestrogens are a possible cause|B. uterine cancer needs to be ruled out|C. urethral caruncle is very rarely a factor|D. post-menopausal vaginal bleeding can be caused by colon cancer	 exogenous oestrogens are a possible cause, uterine cancer needs to be ruled out, post-menopausal vaginal bleeding can be caused by colon cancer	Exogenous oestrogens influence the endometrial lining causing proliferation of the endometrial stroma and glandular proliferation with shedding of this thickened layer is likely with any drop in the level of oestrogen.   Such 'post-menopausal' bleeding is a common effect of female 'hormone replacement therapy' (HRT) (1 True) . Uterine cancer is a very important diagnosis and a common cause of post-menopausal bleeding  \r\n (2 True) .  About 25% of post-menopausal bleeding is due to a genital malignancy. A urethral caruncle is an inflammatory lesion that occurs (quite commonly) at the external urethral meatus, usually in elderly women.  It is a highly vascular lesion with young connective tissue and a variably present epithelial covering of transitional or squamous cells.  It is equally important to examine the external genitalia thoroughly as cancer or infection externally can be interpreted as blood of vaginal origin.  Caruncle is an important and relatively frequent cause of vaginal bleeding  \r\n (3 False). Due to the relatively thin 'window' of the posterior vaginal fornix it is possible, although unusual, for an abdominal cancer to grow through into the vagina to cause bleeding (4 True) .  Due to its thick muscular wall, full thickness infiltration of the uterus is exceedingly uncommon. 	Other MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)
1437	27502	The broad ligament	A. has the ovarian artery in its lower attached border|B. has the ureter passing forward in its lower attached border|C. is the main support of the uterus|D. has the uterine artery cross anterior to the ureter within its lower attached border	 has the ureter passing forward in its lower attached border, has the uterine artery cross anterior to the ureter within its lower attached border	The broad ligament is a loose double fold of peritoneum rather than a ligament; as a result it offers little support to the uterus (3 False).  The uterus is supported by the transverse cervical ligaments which extend laterally to the side wall of the pelvis from the cervix and vaginal fornix on the pelvic floor, within the lower attached border of broad ligament; by the uterosacral ligaments which extend backwards from the cervix to the front of the sacrum, running lateral to the recto-uterine pouch; and by (most importantly) the levator ani muscle. The ureter, uterine artery and inferior hypogastric plexus all traverse the connective tissue of the transverse cervical ligament which is at the base of the broad ligament (2 True).   The ovarian vessels (artery, vein and lymphatics) are contained in the upper lateral part of the broad ligament (1 False). The relationship of the ureter and uterine artery, which cross each other within the transverse cervical ligament (4 True) , is critical in hysterectomy as both the ligament and the uterine artery (but not the ureter!) need to be divided.  The relationship of these structures is seen in Fig 5.59 of Sinnatamby CS, Last's Anatomy, Churchill Livingstone, 1999, 10th Edition and in  .	Other MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

ECG changes with ST depression and T inversion|D. defects in pulmonary perfusion scans|E. normal pulmonary ventilation scans	 ECG changes with ST depression and T inversion	Investigations are also difficult in pulmonary embolism. Disparity between the ventilation and perfusion scans in nuclear medicine techniques is highly specific and usefully sensitive for haemodynamically significant emboli. The ventilation-perfusion mismatch is apparent on blood gas investigations, where there is an alveolar to arterial oxygen tension difference.  Chest X-ray is initially unhelpful; the wedge-shaped radiological opacity occurring later as the lung in the territory of the obstructed artery consolidates. ECG changes are seen in a small minority of patients - those with severe right ventricular overload from pulmonary hypertension. 	Other MCQs	Multiple Choice (Type A)

Simple physics dictates that the pressures in the veins of the dependent limb will tend to increase in the standing posture by up to the equivalent of a column of blood from ankle to heart - a little over a metre of water, about 100 millimetres of mercury. Pumping the blood up the limb on exercise depends on the competence of the valves in the ankle perforators and the deep veins. Cyclic compression of the deep veins pushes blood up the deep veins during their positive pressure excursions. Competent perforators allow blood from the saphenous system to enter the deep veins during their negative pressure excursions, without allowing that blood back into the superficial veins at the next contraction of leg muscles. Even patients with incompetence of the valves in the saphenous system, but competent perforators, experience a fall in venous pressure on walking - though it is not as marked as the fall with competent valves at all levels.

386	12494	The following acid-base data\r	A. lobar atelectasis of the lung|B. starvation|C. septicaemic shock|D. anxiety|E. duodenal ulcer with pyloric obstruction	 septicaemic shock	The data pattern suggests a partially compensated metabolic acidosis because the hypocapnia is accompanied by a low pH and low bicarbonate together with a large negative base excess.  This is not due to atelectasis of the lung, because the low PaCO2 would not be accompanied by the extreme hypoxaemia needed to produce such a severe metabolic acidosis (A false), nor is it due to anxiety as the pH would be raised in the presence of the hypocapnia (D false).  It is not pyloric obstruction (with vomiting) where one would expect acid loss resulting in metabolic alkalosis (E false).  Both starvation and septic shock would result in metabolic acidosis, but the former would be mild and compensated with a higher pH and plasma bicarbonate (B false).  Therefore this severe acid-base disturbance would be most consistent with the anaerobic metabolism of septic shock (C true).	Physiology MCQs	Multiple Choice (Type A)

Cytokines are highly ?receptor-specific?, but most act on a number of different cell types and most appear to influence a number of different target cell functions such as growth, chemotaxis, differentiation.  Accordingly, they are receptor-specific, but not (usually) cell or function specific.	Pathology MCQs	Relationship-Analysis (Type B)

Primary varicoceles in young males are more frequent on the left (2 False) - perhaps related to the differing anatomy of the left-sided gonadal vein compared to the right, or to the fact that males more commonly 'dress on the left'!   The preferred treatment is high gonadal vein ligation (3 False).  Sclerosant injection and local surgery are each hazardous and ineffective.  Varicoceles are best diagnosed with the patient standing, and give the characteristic 'bag of worms' sign.  They collapse on recumbency (4 False).	Other MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

M protein production|E. coagulase production	 specific bacteriophage typing	The classical method of 'typing' staphylococci (both Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative species) in epidemiological investigations is phage typing (D true) although other molecular techniques are slowly being developed (eg plasmid analysis, chromosomal DNA analysis) as are antibiogram analyses for coagulase negative strains.  Colony and colour variation is of little use as most colonies look the same (A false), while the presence or absence of the enzyme coagulase simply serves to delineate the heterogenous species S. aureus from the remaining 20 or so species (C false).  Serological procedures have not been adopted for investigating outbreaks of staphylococcal sepsis (E false) except perhaps for determining the presence of a high level of antibody against cell wall teichoic acids as an indication of chronic staphylococcal infection (eg osteomyelitis).

1499	27627	Prostate cancer is best diagnosed by	A. digital rectal examination|B. prostate specific antigen (PSA) serum levels|C. transrectal ultrasound of the prostate and biopsy|D. a combination of the above three responses|E. cystoscopy and endoscopic biopsy of the prostate	 a combination of the above three responses	When patients are first seen in the consulting rooms wishing a prostate check up, a digital rectal examination and PSA are often done to work-up symptoms or possibly as a routine prostate check.  The definitive form of diagnosis, however, is with a transrectal ultrasound of the prostate with several biopsies.   Diagnosis is best made by a combination of the three previous responses A, B & C (D is correct) .  Biopsies are taken from the base, mid, and apex of each lobe of the prostate gland and submitted for histopathologic review.  Many prostate cancers are isoechoic and hence are unable to be clearly identified on ultrasound, but some are associated with a hypoechoic nodule and hence can be targeted specifically if identified on ultrasound.  There is very little, if any place, for a cystoscopy and endoscopic biopsy in the diagnosis of the vast majority of prostate cancers.  As mentioned earlier, most cancers begin in the peripheral zone rather than in the periurethral zone and hence are unlikely to be sampled endoscopically (E False).

Microscopic haematuria is defined by the individual laboratory giving a normal range (usually less than 104 RBC/ml urine, or less than ten blood cells per high power field).  Urine is also examined for casts, protein, bacteria and crystals.  The aetiology of microscopic haematuria includes glomerulonephritis, renal cell tumour, inflammation, stones, urothelial bladder or renal tumour (transitional cell carcinoma), prostatic causes (benign and malignant enlargement) and urinary tract infection (1 True).  Dysmorphic cells are always present in stale urine but if in fresh urine this may indicate a source of bleeding from glomerulonephritis.  Renal cell tumours typically demonstrate non-glomerulated red cells (2 False). 3.  Haematuria in the younger age group (less than 50 years) and in the absence of protein casts or infection is rarely associated with pathology (3 True) (see Table 7) . \n  Painless macroscopic haematuria is a critical symptom always requiring further investigation - no exceptions (4 True). Microscopic haematuria is always looked for in a patient with severe abdominal pain.  Renal calculi are the most common cause of abdominal pain and haematuria.  The classic triad of presentation of renal cell carcinoma is abdominal pain, macroscopic haematuria and a palpable mass - but the incidence of haematuria with stone disease is   higher (5 False).

Cyanosis requires the delivery of deoxygenated blood to the left heart and so to the systemic circulation: ie right-to-left shunts. Left-to-right shunts do not result in cyanosis, though they increase pulmonary blood flow. A late sequel to the increased volume load on the right ventricle and pulmonary circulation may be attenuation of the pulmonary vasculature, pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure. The murmur of a VSD is pansystolic since it reflects only the pressure profile of the ventricle and not the acceleration of the long, massive, blood column in the aorta, which determines the diamond-shaped systolic murmur of aortic stenosis.

499	952	The most clinically useful form of nutritional assessment related to body weight is:	A. Absolute weight measured on an accurate set of scales.|B. A 72-hour dietary recall history.|C. Body mass index (BMI: weight divided by the square of height).|D. A history of unintentional weight loss greater than 10% over the preceeding 6 months.|E. Body composition measurement using neutron activation.	 A history of unintentional weight loss greater than 10% over the preceeding 6 months.	Body weight can be compared with an "ideal" or "desirable" weight, or assessment of body mass index can be used to determine both undernutrition and overnutrition. However, measurement of body weight in sick patients is confounded by changes in body water because of dehydration, oedema, and ascites. Furthermore, a person who starts at the upper end of the normal range may be classified as "normal" despite considerable changes in the measured value. Dietary recall histories lack reliability and are associated with poor compliance from those who are seriously ill. Unintentional weight loss greater than 10% over the previous six months is a good prognosticator of clinical outcome. However, it can be difficult to determine true weight loss because of errors in recall. It has been estimated that one-third of patients with weight loss would be missed and one-quarter of weight-stable patients would be diagnosed as having lost weight when weight loss is based on patient recall. So, although it is the most clinically useful of the measurements that have been listed, it is a far from perfect measure of nutritional status. Formal measures of body composition, such as neutron activation, provide accurate and precise information, but a detailed understanding of the body's muscle, fat, and water content is more relevant to clinical research than it is to clinical practice.

Both FSH & LH are secreted in the male as well as the female (1 False).  In the male, FSH stimulates the Sertoli cells to control the maturation of spermatids to spermatozoa; and LH is trophic on the interstitial Leydig cells - stimulating androgen production.   Luteinising hormone in the female acts via receptors on theca interna cells (2 True) ; to stimulate ovulation and luteinisation of the ovarian follicle. Research with gonadotrophic releasing hormones (GnRH) have clearly shown that a constant infusion of GnRH will down-regulate the GnRH receptor of the anterior pituitary and hence LH secretion ceases.   An hourly pulse, on the other hand, will stimulate LH secretion (see Ganong) (3 True). Prolactin is another of the hormones secreted by the anterior pituitary.   Its action is to stimulate milk secretion from a breast that is 'primed' by oestrogen and progesterone (4 True) .  Prolactin also inhibits the action of the gonadotropins. \r\n 	Other MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

It relates to chemical carcinogenesis but is applicable, with modification, to radiation and viral oncogenesis.  Rigid classification as 'complete' carcinogens (oncogens, but not oncogenes), initiators and promoters is conceptually useful, but not always easy.

Diiodotyrosine forms about one-third of the iodinated compounds in the thyroglobulin complex (B false).  Two diiodotyrosine molecules undergo oxidative condensation to form thyroxine, still linked to thyroglobulin.  After proteolysis of thyroglobulin the diiodotyrosine and monoiodotyrosine liberated into the cytoplasm are deiodinated and the iodine liberated is reutilised.

Hypoproteinaemia and anaemia, if severe, may contribute, and advanced age is usually associated with other factors such as malnutrition or carcinoma.  Local sepsis or a digestive fistula can contribute to wound necrosis.  Adequate techniques of wound closure using strong nonabsorbable sutures can minimise the risk of disruption.

See Ganong, 19th ed, pages 412-413  This question was referred to the Physiology Sub Committee for review on 1 Feb 2002.  The following comment was provided by the Sub Committee:   \n The major control of FSH at the pituitary level is feedback by the hormone inhibin from the Setoli cells of the seminiferous tubules.  Large doses of testosterone do indeed inhibit GnRH release at hypothalamic level, thereby reducing the drive on secretion of both LH and FSH.  However in terms of the "big picture" on control of gonadotrophin secretion, LH is mainly under negative feedback control by testosterone, thus stabilising testosterone levels, while FSH is mainly under control of inhibin, thereby stabilising spermatogenesis.  The answer is thus somewhat of a judgement call.  This type of question, where there is merit on both sides, tends to get trickier the longer you look at it.

As he has a past history of duodenal ulcer with probable iron loss and a history of active rheumatoid arthritis which will affect iron absorption and mobilisation, he is most likely to have iron deficiency anaemia (A true).  Consequent to this iron deficiency, his plasma iron binding capacity may be increased (C false) although chronic inflammation may reduce the expected rise (B true).

Fifty years ago cancer of the cervix was the leading cause of cancer death in women, it has now been reduced to eighth. The human papilloma virus is currently considered an important factor in cervical oncogenesis (2 True).   This sexually transmitted virus is found in 85% of cervical cancers and interestingly certain sub-types of HPV are specifically associated with these cancers; and a separate group is associated with condylomata.  (This association between HPV and the cervix is well treated in Cotran, Kumar, Collins, Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, Saunders, 6th Edition, 1999; Chapter 24. The peak incidence of cervical cancer is 40-45 years (3 False) but can occur from the second decade to old age.

A. country of origin|B. smoking|C. diet|D. family history|E. presence of lower urinary tract symptoms	 country of origin, family history	There is a significant variation in the incidence of prostate cancer depending on the country of origin of the patient, with Asian countries typically having an extremely low incidence of prostate cancer and most developed western countries having a high incidence (1 True). The incidence, however, of microscopically detected cancers at autopsy are similar throughout all countries; and hence prostate cancer in a western country tends to progress to a clinical stage as opposed to Asian countries.  Migration affects this incidence, as a patient moves from a country of low incidence to high incidence they adopt the incidence of their host country.  Obviously, diet has been implicated - but not proven - as a possible explanation for this differing incidence depending on country of origin (3 False?).  Food substances that have been implicated include dietary fat, isoflavin ingestion (commonly found in soy products), and lycopenes (commonly found in tomato base products).  Other possible explanation include exposure to ultraviolet light as those countries with minimal exposure to ultraviolet light such as the Scandinavian countries or those races that absorb vitamin D poorly (eg African-Americans) have a significant higher incidence of prostate cancer compared to their counterparts.  There is no evidence that smoking is related to prostate cancer (2 False).   Family history has been conclusively shown to be associated with the incidence of prostate cancer with a two-fold incidence of prostate cancer with one first degree relative affected and up to eight to nine times increased risk if two first degree male relatives are affected (4 True) .  The presence of symptoms is not associated with the development of prostate cancer (5 False) as most studies have identified equal number of men with and without symptoms who have been diagnosed with the disease, despite the fact that symptoms was the most common reason why men sought to have their prostates checked.

The upper striated muscle receives its nerve supply from the nucleus ambiguus within the medulla and runs via the cranial root of the accessory to the vagus.  The smooth muscle in the lower part receives its supply via parasympathetic nerves from the dorsal motor vagal nucleus through the vagal plexus with relays in the oesophageal wall.  A dense myenteric nerve plexus with abundant ganglia coordinates muscular activity. The cricopharyngeus, a striated muscle 3 to 5cm wide, closes the upper end of the oesophagus at rest, preventing inspired air entering the gut.  The lower oesophageal sphincter has no defined anatomical features (2 false) but is represented by a zone of high resting pressure (10-15mm of mercury) in the lowest (intra-abdominal) segment below the diaphragm.

This fact is revealed within the spectrum of agonist drugs used clinically.  Dopamine acts on its own receptor and on alpha, beta 1 and beta 2 receptors (A true).  Noradrenaline and adrenaline can engage alpha, beta 1 and beta 2 receptors (D true, C false) but isoproterenol is the most selective in being agonist to only beta 1 and beta 2 receptors (B true).

89	13251	The best evidence for the neuroectodermal origin of the adrenal medulla is that	A. it has a direct arterial supply from the abdominal aorta|B. its venous drainage is into a persisting part of the sub-cardinal vein|C. it lies near the sympathetic trunk|D. its secretory cells are innervated by preganglionic nerve fibres|E. its cells show a well developed granular endoplasmic reticulum	 its secretory cells are innervated by preganglionic nerve fibres	The secretory cells of the adrenal medulla are functionally equivalent to postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system in that they are innervated by preganglionic nerve fibres.  The reason for this is that the adrenal medullary cells share a common origin from neural crest ectoderm with the cell bodies of sympathetic ganglia (D true).  Although the adrenal gland obtains a direct arterial supply from the aorta, this does not indicate its embryological origin from neurectoderm (A false).  Embryological symmetry of the two glands is evident in their venous drainage into the inferior vena cava (on the right side) and the left renal vein (on the left side), both persisting segments of the embryonic subcardinal veins.  However, this does not indicate its neurectodermal origin (B false), the same symmetry being evident in the venous drainage of the gonads.  Neither proximity to the sympathetic trunk, nor the presence of granular endoplasmic reticulum (characteristic of nerve and secretory cells) is proof of the embryological origin of the adrenal medulla (C and E false).

This applies especially to the so-called outer membrane (OM) - a lipid bilayer external to the peptidoglycan structural backbone.  Most antibiotics are not lipid soluble and have difficulty diffusing passively through this membrane; in order to penetrate they must disrupt the layer (eg cationic compounds such as gentamicin), be carried actively through the membrane, or pass through it via the water filled porin channels that bisect the membrane (eg water soluble antibiotics of sufficiently small molecular size).  Extruding from the surface of the OM is the polysaccharide 'tail' of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS).  The lipid A component of LPS is the classical endotoxin of Gram-negatives (although endotoxin and LPS are often used synonymously), while the polysaccharide portion is used in the taxonomy of many Gram-negatives (O or somatic antigen).

Some 300,000 - 400,000 are present at puberty but only some 400 of these follicles will develop enough to expel their ova. The feedback regulation of ovarian function is seen well in   below.  As can be seen,  involution of the corpus luteum means loss of inhibin and oestrogen which removes feedback inhibition of the anterior pituitary and allows for the next cycle to commence (2 True) . \r\n  The mid-cycle burst of LH is responsible for ovulation.  There is a similar, but smaller, pulse of FSH which is of uncertain significance - however  it is not necessary for ovulation (3 False).  Androgens are produced from thecal cells (4 True) .

Seminomas remain confined to the testis longer and typically metastasise to lymph nodes, with blood spread occurring (when it does) as a later phenomenon.  NSGCT metastasise earlier and more frequently by blood stream.  Seminomas are extremely radiosensitive whereas NSGCT are radio-resistant.  Significance of a positive HCG in some seminoma patients is unknown; it does not alter the generally good prognosis for seminoma.	Pathology MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

793	928	Inguinal hernia is	A. More common in male than in female patients.|B. More common than femoral hernia in female patients.|C. Likely to be indirect if the swelling is inguinoscrotal.|D. Classically associated with Richter type hernia (strangulation of part of bowel wall).|E. More prone to recurrence after surgery than is femoral hernia.	 More common in male than in female patients., More common than femoral hernia in female patients., Likely to be indirect if the swelling is inguinoscrotal., More prone to recurrence after surgery than is femoral hernia.	Inguinal hernia is more common in males than females   (1 true).  Looking at the records of your last 100 patients with inguinal hernia, a considerable majority will be males.  The region of the male inguinal canal is more likely to have a congenital sac and also more prone under stress to herniate than the female inguinal canal, which only transmits the round ligament of the uterus in contrast to the male spermatic cord leading to the testis. Inguinal hernias are also more common than femoral hernias overall in both sexes   (2 true).  Looking at the records of the last 100 female patients with groin hernia inguinal hernias will predominate; but the majority will not be so great as in the first example.  Thus in both males and females the inguinal canal region is more likely to give rise to hernia than is the femoral canal area. When an inguinal hernia is found to be inguinoscrotal it is virtually certain to be indirect  (3 true).  Indirect hernias as they enlarge descend with the spermatic cord into the scrotum.  Direct hernias do not; they remain in the groin above the scrotal neck. A Richter hernia describes a strangulated hernia with entrapment of portion of the circumference of the bowel within a hernial sac with a small opening from the peritoneal cavity.  This classically occurs with femoral (not inguinal) hernias (4 false). Overall recurrence after hernia repair is low; but inguinal hernias have in general a higher recurrence rate than do femoral hernias (5 true).  A standard repair of an inguinal hernia defect in males must still leave a passageway for the spermatic cord through the inguinal canal.  Repair of femoral hernias can obliterate or plug the femoral ring and femoral canal completely.	Pathology MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

In the photograph of the abdominal wall  A lies over the linea alba  (1 true).  The aponeuroses of all the abdominal flat muscles are fused between the recti to form the linea alba in the midline.  This runs vertically from the xiphoid to the pubis.  Below the umbilicus it is thinner and weaker than above the umbilicus where the distance between the recti is greater (as shown in the picture).  The fused aponeuroses form a thick felted fibrous band, the fibres criss-cross like a radial ply tyre. B lies at the junction of the lateral rectus edge with the costal margin at the site of the tip of the ninth costal cartilage; which corresponds to the surface anatomy of the fundus of the gall bladder (2 true). The transpyloric plane at level C runs transversely at the mid point between the sternal notch above and pubic symphysis below.  It crosses the costal margin at the tip of the ninth costal cartilage at the lateral rectus edge (3 true); it marks the approximate surface anatomy of the pylorus and the lower border of lumbar vertebra 1.  Its anterior surface manifestation, as well as often corresponding with an abdominal skin crease, as shown in the photograph, can be used to mark the transition from the epigastrium above to the umbilical region below; although many find a more convenient junction at the sub-costal plane, which is at a lower level (approximately at the plane indicated by A) which also often has a transverse skin crease and marks a functional boundary between upper and lower abdominal integument. D, which overlies the umbilicus (4 false) lies approximately at the level of disc between third and fourth lumbar vertebrae (quartering the abdomen around the umbilicus is another common descriptive device).  The transpyloric plane also lies approximately halfway between the lower end of the sternum and the umbilicus.  The bifurcation of the aorta is below and to the left of the umbilicus, at approximately the level of the disc between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae.  The pulsation of the aorta can be felt in slim patients and for the most part is above the umbilicus.  Similarly an aortic aneurysm gives a predominantly epigastric swelling.

1415	27657	What factors may influence choice of initial treatment for prostate cancer?	A. age of patient|B. co-morbid illnesses|C. patient preference|D. doctor preference|E. grade of the cancer	 age of patient, co-morbid illnesses, patient preference, grade of the cancer	Various factors influence the choice of therapy for localised prostate cancer. An older man, in particular, over 70 years of age, especially within the presence of co-morbid illnesses is more likely to die of those co-morbid illnesses rather than from the prostate cancer.  Therefore, the expected ten-year life expectancy of the patient must be taken into account if active therapy is being considered.  Grade of the tumor plays a major role, as a well-differentiated cancer has excellent 10-15 year cause-specific survival regardless of therapy (1, 2 & 5 True). Moderate and poorly differentiated tumors do show a survival advantage of treatment over no treatment and hence it is imperative that one identifies a patient with these grades of tumors before contemplating active therapy. Patient preference also plays a major role in the choice of therapy for localised prostate cancer (3 True) .  The treatment of prostate cancer is commonly associated with impotence, in the case of surgery a low but definite risk of incontinence, and in the case of radiotherapy a low but definite risk of rectal irritation, diarrhea and rectal bleeding.  No early treatment, as a preferred first option, clearly preserves rectal function, continence and erectile ability and hence many patients may choose no initial therapy to avoid the side effects of treatment even if it may ultimately compromise long-term survival.   Doctors' preference should play a relatively minor role in the choice of therapy for the patient in these circumstances (4 False).	Other MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

The cilia are most abundant at the fimbriated end of the tube and beat towards the uterus.  The tube is composed of two layers of muscle (inner circular and outer longitudinal).  The tube widens laterally at the ampulla and infundibulum (4 False). The uterine tube is influenced by both ovarian hormones  (2 True).  Oestrogens cause the glandular tissues to proliferate, as well as an increase in both the number and activity of ciliated cells.  Progesterone promotes secretory changes to enhance nourishment of the fertilised, dividing ovum as it traverses the tube. The paramesonephric (M?llerian) ducts begin to develop in the sixth week as a groove-like invagination of the coelomic epithelium on the lateral aspect of the mesonephric ridge.  The upper (cranial) vertical part forms the uterine tube  whilst the lower (caudal) parts of right and left paramesonephric ducts ultimately fuse to form the uterus (3 True).

Spores in the environment enter cutaneous wounds, and if conditions for germination and growth of the microbe occur - eg necrotic devitalised tissue, anaerobic conditions - the tetanus exotoxin is produced and liberated.  This is a neurotoxin which has been referred to as tetanospasmin.  Prevention of such infections, which may follow apparently minor skin trauma, therefore, relies on preventing conditions suitable for the growth of the anaerobe.  Dead tissue should be excised from wounds which should be left open, ie aerobic (A true).  Treatment consists of high doses of penicillin (B true) and the use of hyperimmune globulin (C true) in an attempt to convey some degree of passive immunity to the toxin.  The main effect of the toxin is muscle hyperirritability.  The toxin blocks inhibitory neurones in the CNS so that stimulatory signals remain unopposed and muscles, including those in the jaw and respiratory system, are constantly stimulated (D true).

The liver is entirely separated by peritoneum from the oesophagus (A false).  The ventral mesentery by which the liver is suspended from the diaphragm forms the left and right triangular ligaments with a bare area bordered by their attachment to the liver.  The subdiaphragmatic part of the inferior vena cava occupies the bare area below the central tendon.  The vena cava is thus an immediate posterior relation of the liver, contained in a groove on its posterior surface (B false).  The ligamentum teres is a rounded fibrous cord in the free lower edge of the falciform ligament.  It is the remnant of the obliterated left umbilical vein of the foetus and it runs in the free edge of the falciform ligament from the umbilicus to the anterior surface of the liver.  It lies in a deep groove, the fissure for the ligamentum teres, on the under surface of the liver as far as the left end of the porta hepatis (C false).  The lower reflection of the right triangular ligament runs horizontally across the diaphragm near the level of the upper pole of the right kidney; the right adrenal gland lies in the bare area along with the inferior vena cava.  The renal fascia surrounds the kidney and sends an extension over the right adrenal (D true).	Anatomy MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

Thiamine deficiency is seen in starving alcoholics and extreme dieters: the lesion is biochemical, since thiamine forms a cofactor for enzymes in energy metabolism of glucose, and patients develop acute left ventricular failure which is promptly reversed by thiamine injection. Dilated cardiomyopathy, seen as an idiopathic state, or as a late sequel of viral myocarditis, or in chronically debilitated alcoholics, shows a biopsy picture of extensive fibrosis, rather than an active inflammatory process.

Thus DIC is associated with a haemorrhagic diathesis (C true).  The deposition of fibrin within the microvasculature may lead to haemolytic anaemia (A true).  Fibrinogen breakdown products include anticoagulant substances (D true).  The events characterising DIC result in renal ischaemia, even to a degree of bilateral renal cortical necrosis, as can a number of the conditions which precipitate DIC (B true).

Microbes are usually readily visible in biopsy material. Lymph node involvement is characteristically seen in a variety of disease, including toxoplasmosis (A true), the secondary stage of syphilis (B true), primary pulmonary tuberculosis (D true), but not in tertiary syphilis, where the clinical manifestations are vasculitis and chronic inflammation (C false).  These tertiary lesions (gummas) are presumed to result from the host's response to treponemal antigens although they usually contain few or no visible spirochaetes.

Less than 5% of cases of colorectal cancer arise in the setting of pre-existing familial adenomatous polyposis or inflammatory bowel disease - responses (1 and 2) are correct.  Peak incidence for colorectal carcinoma is 60-70 years ie the incidence increases with increasing age.  Less than 25% are located in the rectosigmoid and this trend of higher incidence of proximal involvement is more prevalent in Australasia.	Pathology MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

S is true and R is false|D. S is false and R is true|E. both S and R and false	 S is true, R is true and a valid explanation of S	The umbilicus is an area of potential communication between the portal and systemic venous circulation. In the fetus, fetal blood is oxygenated in the placenta, not in the lungs, and returns from the placenta via the left umbilical vein to the portal venous system by  running into the left portal vein in the porta hepatis  (R true).  This oxygenated blood then short circuits the liver by running directly into the systemic circulation to the inferior vena cava via the ductus venosus.  The two vessels (left umbilical vein and ductus venosus) run in a cleft in the liver from front to rear along its inferior surface.  After birth the left umbilical vein and ductus venosus become fibrous cords - the ligamentum teres and ligamentum venosum - which lie imbedded in their respective fissures. After birth the umbilicus becomes the watershed between cephalic and caudal direction of venous return from the subcutaneous tissues.  Anastomosing networks of veins radiate upwards via the lateral thoracic vein to axillary vein; and downwards to the great saphenous vein and femoral vein.  Within the peritoneal cavity, veins within the ligamentum teres continue to drain into the portal system.  In portal hypertension shunting of blood occurs from the portal to the systemic venous circulation via the ligamentum teres and umbilicus to the subcutaneous veins.  These dilate and run centrifugally from the umbilicus - upwards and downwards to either the axillary or femoral veins,  forming a Caput Medusae (S true).  These anastomotic channels are an aid to diagnosis of portal hypertension.   Both S and R are thus correct and R validly explains S. Dilated subcutaneous abdominal wall collateral venous channels are also seen following thrombosis of the inferior vena cava.  In this instance the venous flow is entirely upwards. The other main site of collateral venous channels linking portal and systemic circulations in portal hypertension is across the mucosa of stomach and oesophagus as oesophageal submucosal varices.

Pathology Sub Committee comments:   \n This question relates to molecules having a direct influence on leukocyte pavementing.   \n 1.   It is resonable to assess mediators   causing pavementing (ie. leukocyte - endothelial adhesion) as the interactive adhesion molecules (selectins, integrins, ICAM-1, VCAM-1) on endothelial cells and leukocytes; \r\n 2.   Mediators   influencing pavementing are those which induce expression of those adhesion molecules on the surfaces of endothelial cells (IL-1, TNF) and of leukocytes (C5a at least); \r\n 3.   Anything even more remote from direct indluence (including bradykinin) is surely highly speculative as having   effect.  Bradykinin certainly has no direct effect (ie. as an adhesion molecule per se) or even at the next level (ie influencing the expression of those adhesion molecules). This question has been reviewed.

Of more minor but still significant risk are Gram-negative coliforms, eg Escherichia coli, which may adhere to any foreign material/implants.  This group of microbes is more significant in valve replacement rather than artery graft surgery.  The antibiotic(s) to be used must therefore cover all types of staphylococci plus or minus Gram-negative coliforms.  Second generation cephalosporins adequately fill this role (eg cefamandole, cefuroxime), although most consider the first generation cephazolin (slightly less coliform activity than second generation compounds) also acceptable in artery graft procedures.  While most surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is now given parenterally at the induction of anaesthesia (ie around 20 minutes before incision) some institutions favour oral administration (which is clearly cheaper).  However, the timing of any orally administered drug is critical, as maximum levels of drug must be present in the tissues to be involved (ie skin, heart, and arteries) at the time of incision.  Clearly parenteral regimens offer more control on this aspect of prophylaxis, and as demonstrated in the classical studies of Burke, must be given within the 2-hour period proceeding operation.  Significantly elevated levels of surgical-site sepsis are seen when intravenous antibiotics are given more than two hours before incision, or after commencement of the operation.

398	13289	Which of the following is an enzyme?	A. bradykinin|B. angiotensin 11|C. vasopressin|D. gastrin|E. renin	 renin	The nonapeptide bradykinin is one of the vasodilator peptides formed in the plasma.  The octapeptide angiotensin II is the most potent vasoconstrictor known and acts directly on the adrenal cortex, on peripheral noradrenergic neurons, and on water metabolism as well.  The nonapeptide vasopressin (ADH) is one of the two posterior pituitary gland hormones.  Its main physiologic effect is the retention of water by the kidney.  Gastrin is a polypeptide hormone produced by the G cells of the gastric antral mucosa.  Its principal action is stimulation of gastric acid and pepsin secretion.  The above mentioned four physiologically active peptides (or polypeptides) have no enzymatic activity (A, B, C and D false).  Renin is a proteolytic enzyme secreted by the kidney into the bloodstream, with a molecular weight of 40 000 in humans.  It splits the end off one of the plasma proteins called renin substrate, to release a decapeptide, angiotensin I (E true).	Physiology MCQs	Multiple Choice (Type A)

Classically associated with strangulation bowl obstruction of Richter type.|E. More prone to recurrence after surgery than is inguinal hernia.	 More common in female than in male patients., Classically associated with strangulation bowl obstruction of Richter type.	Femoral hernia is more common in females than in males   (1 true).  You would need to go back further to find the records of 100 femoral hernia repairs, because femoral hernias are much less common than are inguinal hernias.  But there would be a majority of females in your group.  The femoral ring and canal are wider in females than males, in keeping with the wider female pelvis. Inguinal hernias outnumber femoral in women as well as in men (2 false).  Thus if you identify a groin hernia and you cannot be sure of the clinical diagnosis in a male, the odds on it being inguinal are quite high.  In a woman under the same circumstances the hernia is also more likely to be inguinal, but the odds will not be so great. For most hernias, a truss is not a reliable method of control.  The hernia must be reducible and the truss needs to control the defect and prevent the hernia escaping.  If the hernia does protrude while a truss is worn, the effectiveness of the truss is lost and the risk of strangulation increased.  A truss might be occasionally helpful in an infirm patient when the mouth of the hernial sac is wide, the hernia is easily reducible and the risk of strangulation considered low.  Femoral hernias have a small neck and a tortuous sac pathway and are particularly unsuited to truss use (3 false). Response 4 is true and 5 false (see X1).	Pathology MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

Placement of a tampon can be an easy way to resolve the problem if a thorough clinical examination does not demonstrate the source. Yes, it is reported that some  70% of ruptured ectopics will have some vaginal loss at the time of presentation (3 True) .  This can be misleading as it can be interpreted as the late arrival of the previously missed period.  Remember this fact. Excessive menstrual loss is a feature of hypothyroidism (myxoedema).   Menstrual loss can become scanty or absent in Graves' disease (hyperthyroidism); and oligomenorrhoea may be a presenting symptom (4 False). 	Other MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)

The most common are problems in advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer and are associated with ongoing progression of bony metastatic disease as well as morbidity related to local spread.   Hence ongoing bone pain is an issue and if affecting the thoracic/lumbar cord may lead to cord compression and to a rapid onset of paraparesis and paraplegia in affected individuals (1 True) .  This needs prompt treatment with urgent radiotherapy, or if unsuccessful urgent decompression laminectomy.  Other strategies to assist in the management of bone pain include local radiotherapy, chemotherapy using mitozantrone and steroids, administration of radioactive strontium or palladium, referral to palliative care team and administration of analgesia (for example, MS Contin). The other problems relate to local growth of tumour, which include ongoing lower urinary tract symptoms, such as hesitancy, diminishing urinary stream, frequency, and nocturia (which may require palliative TURP) as well as  haematuria due to the fragility of the neoplastic blood vessels (which may require cystoscopy and diathermy) (2 True).  As the tumour infiltrates the base of the bladder, bilateral ureteric obstruction is a common accompaniment of the disease requiring endoscopic manipulation in the form of nephrostomies and ureteric stents (4 True) .  Hepatic and lung metastases are uncommon in advanced prostate cancer, although they may occur; but require palliation far less frequently than the previously mentioned problems (3 & 5 False). Resolved Nov 2003 1. Microscopic haematuria is defined by the individual laboratory giving a normal range (usually less than 104 RBC/ml urine, or less than ten blood cells per high power field).  Urine is also examined for casts, protein, bacteria and crystals.  The aetiology of microscopic haematuria includes glomerulonephritis, renal cell tumour, inflammation, stones, urothelial bladder or renal tumour (transitional cell carcinoma), prostatic causes (benign and malignant enlargement) and urinary tract infection (1 True).  Dysmorphic cells are always present in stale urine but if in fresh urine this may indicate a source of bleeding from glomerulonephritis.  Renal cell tumours typically demonstrate non-glomerulated red cells (2 False). 3.  Haematuria in the younger age group (less than 50 years) and in the absence of protein casts or infection is rarely associated with pathology (3 True) (see Table 7) . \n  Painless macroscopic haematuria is a critical symptom always requiring further investigation - no exceptions (4 True). Microscopic haematuria is always looked for in a patient with severe abdominal pain.  Renal calculi are the most common cause of abdominal pain and haematuria.  The classic triad of presentation of renal cell carcinoma is abdominal pain, macroscopic haematuria and a palpable mass - but the incidence of haematuria with stone disease is   higher (5 False). If abdominal pain is present with haematuria the cause is usually renal pathology.  In the absence of haematuria we look for other causes of severe pain, including pancreatitis, perforated ulcer and ruptured aortic aneurysm ( ).

Remember your A B Cs (as per EMST). \r\n  CT scanning allows assessment of renal perfusion; the presence and function of the contralateral kidney; the extent, if any, of perirenal haematoma; and the presence or absence of urinary extravasation (2 True).   If CT scans are not available intravenous pyelography may be used but this study is inadequate in 20% of cases.  In the presence of continued or severe haemorrhage, arteriography may be helpful to elucidate the site of arterial bleeding and the presence or absence of arteriovenous malformation. Surgical exploration and repair or nephrectomy may be necessary in the presence of continued severe haemorrhage.  Patients who respond to blood transfusion and remain stable do not necessarily require exploration.  Surgery will more often be required for assessment and treatment of other intra-abdominal injuries include damage to spleen, duodenum and bowel  \r\n (3 False). Causes of hypertension include: Approach should be from a midline vertical laparotomy incision to obtain best exposure and vascular control when dealing with renal trauma (5 False). Penetrating renal trauma (bullets and stab injury) will commonly be associated with injuries to other intra-abdominal and thoracic viscera.  Surgical exploration will almost invariably be necessary to repair other structures and to perform drainage.  High powered shotgun injuries will be associated with more widespread tissue destruction and necrosis requiring, at times, extensive debridement and drainage (6 True).

336	25931		A. the half-life of digoxin would be increased|B. the clearance of lignocaine would be increased|C. the half-life of vancomycin would be decreased|D. the clearance of metronidazole would be decreased	 the half-life of digoxin would be increased	Significant cardiac failure causes decreased perfusion of both the kidney and the liver.  Plasma half-life is a pharmacokinetic function dependent upon the rate of clearance of a compound.  Whether decreased liver perfusion has an effect upon hepatic clearance depends upon whether the drug has a high liver extraction and flow-dependent clearance (eg diltiazem, lignocaine, imiprimine, midazolam, morphine, naloxone).  For a drug with a high extraction ratio, changes due to enzyme induction or hepatic disease should have little effect.  Whilst metronidazole is metabolised in the liver, its clearance is not flow dependent and cardiac failure will not significantly alter its half-life.  Likewise changes in plasma protein binding should have little influence on a flow-dependent drug.  This can be compared with drugs which have low extraction ratios in the liver, and whose clearance will be significantly affected by changes in intrinsic clearance such as enzyme induction or inhibition, and by protein binding (eg phenytoin, salicylic acid and warfarin).   \n Digoxin?s clearance is predominantly renal, both glomerular filtration and some active secretion down the pathways for basic compounds.  Its half-life is significantly increased by both decreased perfusion of the kidney and by glomerular loss such as occurs with age.  Vancomycin?s excretion entirely depends upon glomerular filtration, and with the increase in half-life which would occur in cardiac failure, the risk of toxicity is increased.  Plasma level monitoring is therefore important.	Other MCQs	Multiple True/False (Type X)
